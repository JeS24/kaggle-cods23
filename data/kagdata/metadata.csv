Collection and Presentation of Data - II, we already know that data can be presented using the frequency distribution table for example the age of thirtysudencs at as school can be presented using an ungrouped frequency distribution table as shown here you can derive the dispoints from the stable for example we can see that there are six students of eight thirteen years now suppose you were given the data composed of the ages of hundred students can you present this data using an ungrouped frequency distribution table yes it can be presented using an ungrouped frequency distribution table but it will be at time consuming exercise is nt it thus to present such an large amount of data that easily make sense to ar reader we can then the egg into groups like five to seven eighty ten eleven to thirteen fourteen to sixteen and seventeentnineteen since are were the ranges from eight five to nineteenth observe that in the age group five to seven years there are nineteenth students in the group eight ten years there are twenty three students similarly the frequency for other groups can be found out as shown here these groups are call or class intervals in each of these classes the smaller number is called the lower class limit and the greater number is called the upper class limit for example in eleven to thirteen eleven is the lower class limit and thirteen is the upper class limit do you know what is the class size of class interval the class size of ar class interval is the deferens of the upper class limit and the lower class limit we also call class five as class weight in this case the class weight is too observe that the class wet or size is the same for all the intervals now suppose two students of eggs ten point five years and thirteen point five years are newly admitted in the school can you tell which class interval will include limit will they be ncluded in the intervals eight to ten and eleven to thirteen respectively no the cause the upper limit of the interval eightyten is ten and so it cannot include value ten point five which is more than ten similarly thirteen point five cannot be included in the interval eleven to thirteen for the same reason so what to do now to overcome this problem we pre down the gaps between the intervals in such away at the upper and lower limits of consecutive intervals are the same we find the difference between the upper limit of class and the lower limit of its succeeding class then find the half of this difference which comes out as there point five for this problem we then add this value to eighth of the upper limits and subtract this value from each of the lower limits in this way we have revive to the class intervals in such away at the upper class limit of an interval is same as the lower class limit of its succeeding class interval this kind of distribution of data is called can the as frequency distribution now can you include the values ten point five and thirteen point five still confused then point five appears into different class intervals thirteen point five two appears into different class intervals in such a case there is at convention by which we include the value of lower class limit of ar class interval in the same interval but the value of upper class interval is not included limit instead it is included in an next class interval so then point five will be included in the interval ten point five to thirteen point five whereas thirteen point five will be included in the interval thirteen point five to sixteen point five therefore in this way you have now learn how to present data using of grouped frequency table here is at quegrecap of worwe have learned so far,"['upper class interval', 'upper class limit', 'lower class limit', 'class interval', 'class intervals', 'class', 'frequency distribution table', 'same interval', 'frequency table', 'frequency distribution', 'lower limit', 'upper limit', 'greater number', 'smaller number', 'other groups', 'nineteenth students', 'age group', 'large amount', 'upper limits', 'lower limits', 'same reason', 'frequency', 'interval', 'upper', 'limit', 'same', 'group', 'nineteenth', 'groups', 'students', 'age', 'distribution', 'intervals']"
Frequency Polygon, there is the same ar picture is for ar thousand words this holds true even in mathematics where ar glass is the better way to represent at data usually glass are used for the comparisons among individual items we are already aware about the graphical representation of continuous grouped frequency distribution by the means of or histogram this there any other graphical method for presenting the continuous group frequency distribution yes the meter other than his to gram is of frequency polygon ar frequency polygon has and added at one ice over histogram when you have two or more sets of data to compare wequensypolegon is the better way the cause you can have frequenceqpoli cone for all det aces on one single rod however this is not the case with histograms how can it be drawn there are two methods of dringoe frequency polygon the first one is with the help of or histogram and the second on is without the help of or his or the us discuss the first method consider the following histogram now the mid points of the opposite of the adjacent rectangles of the histogram assume that ar rectangle of zero height exists preceding the first fretangle and mark its mid point similarly assume are tangled succeeding the glass rectangle and mark its mid point join or mid points in order by line segments the close figure so obtained is the frequency polygon now lets discuss the second meter consider the following frequency distribution table showing the lens of three hundred and thirty river else how can we draw of frequency polygon for this data without using or histogram let us understand always remember that the classes should be continuous to draw of frequency polygon if the classes are this continuous you has to first can for them to continuous classes then proceed further now we calculate the class mass that is midpoint of each class the class mark is has of the sum of the lower limit and the upper limit of the class for the first class twenty to pot the upper limit is forty and the lower limit is twenty so the class mark is frty in the class forty to sixty the upper limit is sixty and the lower limit is forty so the class mark is fifty similarly we calculate the class mass of the remaining classes now the king these class masks as excornetes and the cos pointing frequencies as vi cord nets we get the coordinates of the points thirty sixty fifty one hundred eight seventy ninety ninety sixty and one hundred ten forty now jar exaces and way axes on a claspaper with king man now consider taste one centimetre equals twenty centimetres on the ex as and one centimeter equals twenty eel on the viaxes lets we quesent the lens of eel one exaxes and the frequencies that is number of eels on viaxes now we plot the points thirty sixty fifty one hundred eight seventy ninety ninety sixty and one hundred ten forty on the graph paper join the consecutive points by line segments now to complete the polygon we find the mid point of the class preceding the first class mark the point with co frequency join the first end point to this point similarly we mark the mid point of the class succeeding the class class with seed of frequency now join the points to complete the frequency polygon this is the regard frequency polygon now to cat this frequency polygon and anus on questions vas toned can you write the frequency of the class ninety to one twenty yes you can identipie the point between the class ninety to one twenty here it is its excoriat that is the mid point of the class is one hundred five and the vi codon that is the frequency of the class is folifive so the frequency of the class ninety to one twenty is forty five now state the class whose frequencies fifteen since the frequencies are shown on the viaxes the excornate of the point whose py cordinat is fifteen is one hundred sixty five the mid point of the class one fifty to one eight is one sixty five hence the class whose frequencies fifteen is one fifty to one eighty the next question is which class has the max man frequency the frequency is shown on the viaxes on the polygon the max man value of the viquodneight is forty five its corresponding exportnate is one hundred five which is the mid point of the class ninety to one twenty therefore the maximum frequency is in the class ninety two and twenty here is the next question write the classes whose frequencies are zero the frequencies of the classes zero to thirty and one eighty to two hundred ten are zero in this way you can interpret the frequency polygons in or not shell afrequency polygon is the closed curve representing continuous group frequency distribution there are two methods of drawing of frequency polygon with the help of or histogram and without the help of or histogram here are the steps to draw of frequency polygon with the help of or histogram these are the steps to draw of frequency polygon without the help of histogram,"['frequency polygon

Mean, mean in our day to day life we talk about averages all the time like the average speed of car the average score of test the average height of basket ball players the average wage or income do you know what an average is an average is the central value of a set of numbers for a data set the term average an arithmetic mean are used synonymously to refer to a central value of set of numbers the arithmetic mean or simply mean of observations ex one ex to and so on up to ex m is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations the arithmetic mean is normally denoted by ex bar let us take an example the arithmetic mean of five values six three four five and seven is six plus three plus four plus five plus seven divided by five on simplification arithmetic mean is equal to five,"['basket ball players', 'average', 'central value', 'day life', 'ex', 'arithmetic', 'day']"
Angle Sum Property, angle sum property done by an looking confused sister an not able to understand that in the sum of all the angles of ar triangle is equal to one eightydegrees to be confused it release let be explain it to you ocess the please help me to understand it take sheet of paper and draw triangle on it ogai have drawn the triangle sister to take the set in at the triangle out of the paper ii have got on the triangles on the paper now what next good tan the angles of the triangle as ext why and set yes at the that no at the canes of the triangle og it is tan ester now what should ihav to do next now draw trait ran one at the cheeofpapr i have drawn testa line tan do you know the angles and and all the pieces of the triangle at taken together it is trait angle which is equal to one eightydegrees good you can see that trait angles form by all the three angles of the triangle angle ext angle why and angle at there for the sum of all the angles of the triangle tale to an ateegrees yes astr now ihave on the to that the sum of all the angles of triangle is equal to one eightydegrees tank you sister,"['triangle angle', 'testa line tan', 'good tan', 'triangle sister', 'angle sum', 'eightydegrees good', 'angle', 'triangle', 'paper ii', 'tan', 'eightydegrees', 'sum', 'sister', 'paper']"
Inequality Property of Triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of triangle is greater than the third side let us construct a triangle with sides having lengths equal do be and now we arrange the two sides of the triangle having lengths equal to and b in the form of a straight line as shown what do we observe we observe that the sum of and b is greater than c again let us arrange the two sides of the triangle having lengths equal to and c in the form of a straight line as shown what do we observe we observe that the sum of b and c is greater than again let us arrange the two sides of the triangle having lengths equal to and c in the form of straight line as shown what do we observe we observe that the sum of and c is greater than be from these three cases we can conclude that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the third side,"['lengths equal', 'third side', 'lengths']"
Triangle and its Classification, come children let us the gas triangle angles classification can you see triangles on this image it is no or rides that triangles are all around us real world examples of triangles can be found in many different areas of every day lies at triangle is the simple close care made up of three line segments it has three sides ab bc and ca three angles angle abc angle b ac and angle ac b and three word to says b and c the three angles and the three sides of triangle are gas the six elements of triangle side opposite to given angle or words side opposite to angle is bc side opposite to angle b is ac sight opposite to angle c is ab there are different tides of triangles triangles are classified on the basis of sides and angles on the basis of sides triangles can be classified into three tides namely equilateral triangle as to cell triangle and scale triangle and equilatriangle is at triangle in which all sides have equal length an acute is triangle is triangle in which two sides have equal length ascaling triangle is at triangle in which all the sides have different length on the basis of angles triangles can be classified into three tides namely right angled triangle acute angle triangle obtuse angled triangle a right angled triangle has he right angle in its interior an acute angle triangle has all acute angles that is less ln nt degree in its interior an obtuse angled triangle has an obtuse angle that is great an anti degree at less than one at degree in its interior hence triangle can be classified into six tides as shown,"['triangle acute angle triangle', 'acute angle triangle', 'triangle side opposite', 'triangle angles', 'hence triangle', 'angles angle', 'angle b', 'triangle', 'different length', 'side opposite', 'angle', 'acute angles', 'different', 'angles triangles', 'anti degree', 'line segments', 'triangles triangles', 'close', 'world', 'angles', 'length', 'acute', 'opposite', 'degree', 'triangles', 'b']"
Parts of a Triangle, let us recall the definition and parts of the triangle a triangle is simple closed curve made up of three line segments a triangle bc has three sides ab bc dc it has three interior angles angle bc angle bc and angle ac b also it has three vertices b dc interior and exterior of the triangle if we draw a triangle in ar plane it divides the plane into three parts first is boundary of the triangle second is interior of the triangle third is exterior of triangle the points l m n and lie on the boundary of the triangle we can see clearly at the points b are and s lie in the interior of the triangle and the points b c and lie in the exterior of the triangle obviously the angles bc bc and dc b are interior angles of the triangle the angles cd b cb f are the exterior angles of the triangle,"['angles bc bc', 'triangle bc', 'b', 'ar plane', 'line segments', 'angles', 'bc', 'triangle', 'closed', 'plane']"
Exterior Angle Property, father am not able to solve some problems is on exterior angle property sin in he triangle the exteial angle is equal to the sum of two opposite interior angles well father am not able to understand it occai will explain to you bring sheet of paper sister and of scale from your room i have brought them draw a triangle on the sheet of paper ihave brown it use sister and cut the triangle out of the paper i have done it good my corners of the triangle as ex why and said representing its angles i have done it now cataany two corners of the triangle ihave done it now arranged testeces on the line here it is an exterior angle of triangle yes father now we arrange the pieces ex and why what did you several these two pieces core exterior angle completely an testeces are in pear angles of the triangle now i understand the exterior angle of triangle is equal to the sum of two opposite in the angles tank you father,"['pieces core exterior angle', 'exterior angle property', 'opposite interior angles', 'paper ihave', 'exterior angle', 'ihave', 'angles', 'angle', 'paper', 'pieces', 'opposite']"
SSS Congruence Rule, let us discuss excess congruent rule thus consider these two triangles and f we are only one pair of corresponding sides are equal here we observe that one triangles does not cover other triangle completely hence these triangles are not congruent let us take another clase where two pairs of corresponding sides are equal in this case also we observe that triangles do not cover each other completely and exactly so they are also not congruent now let us take the case where both the triangles have equal corresponding sides in this situation triangles cover each other completely and exactly hence we conclude that in this case triangles are congruent,"['corresponding', 'triangles', 'congruent', 'other']"
SAS Congruence Rule, say as congruent role in say congruent rule two triangles are said to be congruent if two sides and the included angles of one triangle are equal to the two sides and the included angle of the other triangle consider triangle in which side is equal to six centimetres angle is equal to sixty degrees and side is equal to four centimetres take another triangle pure by draging vertex cu make side equal to six centimetres then drag vertex to make angle equal to sixty degrees and in last without disturbing length of side and angle drag vertex to make side are equal to four centimetres here we triangle are so formed is exactly same as triangle at therefore triangle is congruent to triangle pure thus in two triangles whenever two sides and the included angles of one triangle are equal to the two sides and the included angles of the other triangle then they are said to be congruent me travel we call it as the side angle side congruent room or in short congruent rule consider another situation the triangle wide aid in which side car is equal to five centimetres side by said is equal to four centimetres and angle ad is equal to follow five degrees again in triangle pure it is tragvrtexc to make side equal to five centimetres or drag vertex to make side are equal to four centimetres and in last without disturbing the length of side and dry to make angle equal to forty five degrees are these two triangles congruent no we notice that these two triangles are not congruent so it is very important that the equal angles are included between the pigs of equal sides thus say congruent rule bolts but not as or rule,"['side angle side congruent', 'congruent rule', 'angle drag vertex', 'angle equal', 'side equal', 'congruent', 'triangle wide', 'centimetres angle', 'centimetres side', 'angle', 'side', 'drag vertex', 'triangle', 'equal', 'vertex', 'rule', 'centimetres']"
ASA Congruence Rule, congruent rule in is congruent rule two triangles as sin to be congruent if two angles and the included sand of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of the other triangle considered triangle bc in which angle is equal to sixty degrees side is equal to six cent meters and angle is equal to forty five degrees take another triangle you are by tragging vertex are make angle bp equals to sixty degrees then without disturbing angle bp drag vertex cu to make side equal to six cent meters and in the last without disturbing angle and length of side dragbrtics are to make angle cu equals to forty five degrees here we see triangle you are so formed is exactly the same as triangle abc therefore triangle bc is congruent to triangle pure thus in two triangles whenever two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides between the corresponding equal pairs of angles are equal then two triangles are said to be congruent to each other we call it as the angle side angle congruence rule or in short congruent rule suppose in two triangles two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are equal but the side is not included between the corresponding equal pairs of angles are the triangles till congruent yes because we know that the sum of the three angles of ar triangle is an hundred and eighty degrees so with two pairs of angles are equal the third barriers also equal hence they are also congruent to each other so two triangles of congruent be any two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding sides are we may called as the angle angle side or side angle angle congruent through or simply as or congruent through,"['side angle angle congruent', 'angle angle side', 'angle side angle', 'side equal', 'corresponding equal', 'angle', 'third barriers', 'cent meters', 'triangle', 'side', 'equal', 'congruent', 'corresponding', 'vertex']"
Bar Graphs, bar graphs the bar graph is at pictorial representation of data in which usually thousand uniform width are drawn with equal spacing between them on one axis say the ex axis depicting the variable the values of the variable are shown on the other axis say the by axis and the heights of the bars depend upon the values of the variable to put more light on bar graphs let us consider ar situation the family with the monthly income of four thousand dollars had planned the following expenditures for month under various heads let us draw abrograph of this data to draw the borograph of this data we have to take on stand note that the unit in the second collar is hundred dollars so eight against grocery means eight hundred dollars step one we represent the heads variable on the horizontal aces choosing any skin since the width of the bar is not important but for clarity we take equal wins for all graphs and maintain equal gaps in between that one head we represented by one mol step too we represent the expenditure vary hundred axes as the maximum expenditure is eleven hundred dollars we can choose escape as one human is an hundred dollars step three to represent our first head that is grocery we draw rectangular bath with with one even and height eight is similarly other heads the represented leaving an gap of one human in between two consecutive bars here we can easily visual like the relative characteristics of the data at an glands for example the expenditure on education is more than double than that of few expenses therefore in some ways biograph serves as better representation of data than the tabular on,"['other heads', 'other axis', 'horizontal aces', 'second collar', 'stand note', 'monthly income', 'ar situation', 'more light', 'uniform width', 'equal', 'heads', 'step', 'representation', 'bar', 'axis', 'more', 'width', 'bars']"
Collection and Presentation of Data - I, according to remote in two thousand dating it was found that ninety percent of the world data was created in the previous two years but do you know what is data and what is the type of this data facts or figures which can be the mericl or otherwise collected with definite purpose are collectively called data data is the plural vas of the latin were data observe the information given here it is gathered from as source which already had this information told this kind of data called second re data but what about primary data unlike second re data for primary data the information is collected directly by the investigata for example data on age of the students in your class room collected by asking the students directly is considered as primary data therefore to be precise we can seta when the information is collected by the investigata with the definite objective in their mind the data obtained is called primary data and when the information is gathered from as source which already had been formation told the data obtained is called second ry data citistics is the signs of making sense of data and presenting it either visually or through statements citistics also helps us to make better decisions do you want to know how lets presume that you are the marketing manager of as social media company your company is running ten different pages on asocial media as the marketing managa you must promote your content and increase your followers how would you do it here you can say that there are many ways in which you can do this one we would be to identify the city in which your company has its maximum views the question is how do you identify it perhaps you may want to make this decision please on your favourite city but wait do nt you think that that will be a little by is yes in situations like these the most appropriate rate decide is to use data it helps us make on by is decisions you may have an insisoption on your social media pays from here you go to the followerbrigd on section and collect data about the top locations of each of those dates say let select the data here ar don't you think your data is all over the place i think so to lets present this data by creating at table for better clarity this can be done by creating two columns one for the city and the other one for the frequency that is the number of times the name of the city appears on the days for instance the first city is daily we count the number of times deliapears one two three and for that is right the frequency for delay is fold lets do the same for all the other cities here we can clearly see from the table that dee has the highest number of views presenting data in this kind of tabular form is known as ungrouped frequency distribution so this was all about data and its present tation through an ungrouped frequency distribution table here is ar quick reta of what we have learnt so far,"['data data', 'data citistics', 'data', 'frequency distribution', 'tabular form', 'highest number', 'other cities', 'fold lets', 'times deliapears', 'lets present', 'top locations', 'maximum views', 'many ways', 'different pages', 'class room', 'plural vas', 'media', 'rate', 'city', 'marketing', 'better', 'definite', 'frequency', 'citistics', 'present', 'views', 'times', 'number', 'other', 'lets']"

Plotting Points and Lines, we already know how to point the pordinates of apoint in cordinat plane the position of apoint can be determined by its distance from the two axes ex and vi the excordinate of apoint is its perpendicular distance from the way aces and the vi cordinat of the point is its perpendicular distance from the excess observe that the perpendicular distance of the given point be from py axes is for and its perpendicular distance from ex aces is five they are for the cordinat of the point be four five in this way you can find the porinates of any given point in the cordinatplane but when you or given the pordinates of a point how will you la this point in he cordinatplaine this understand this consider apoint negative three fito plot this point at first draw exaces and vi axes on the plane show their intersection point which is the origin as zero we know that in the cordinates of apoint first point is excrdna and the second von is the vi cordna we also know that excodinate of apoint is the perpendicular distance of the point from the paces along the exacs and the vi cordinat is the perpendicular distance of the point from the ex axes along the waxes as we excordinate of the point is negative three count three units from the origin towards the negative ex access mark this point as now as the vi cordinat of the point is point starting from at move five units towards the positive access mark the final position as point be you can observe that the perpendicular distances of the point be from ex axes and vi axes are five units and three units respectively hence we is the position of the point negative three five alternatively you can plot this point as follows count three units from the origin towards the negative ex access mark this point as from this point draw al line pl to vi axes now count five units from the origin towards the positive by axes mark this point as ba from we draw line pale to ex aces the point of intersection of these two loints is the point negative three five do you know the codon in which this point lies the excordinate of this point is negative and the vi cordinat is positive the point lies in the second quadrant do reinforce our understanding of plotting of points lets discuss an example plot the points ex three seven why zero at and set six ix check whether they are collinear to plot the points ex three seven move three units from the origin towards the positive exacces mark this point as starting from point move seven units towrds the positive was this is final position of point as as excordinate of the point py is zero there is no movement along ex access as vi cordinat of the point is it move eight units from origin towards the positive viacces mark this position as vi this is the position of the point zero at similarly the point set six ix can bicplorted by moving six units along eat of ex and by aces you can notice that all the three points lie on astreet line hence they are collinear so in an at shell are point why can be plate on a cordinatplain by moving ex units from the origin on the excess and then moving vi units along bias alternatively to plot the point ex poi move ex units from the origin on the ex access,"['negative ex access', 'point ex', 'ex access', 'ex aces', 'ex axes', 'axes ex', 'ex', 'first point', 'point py', 'point negative', 'positive access', 'perpendicular distance', 'cordinat plane', 'point', 'ix check', 'final position', 'excess observe', 'line', 'py axes', 'positive', 'perpendicular', 'second', 'plot', 'cordinat', 'excess', 'ix', 'observe', 'position', 'aces', 'first', 'axes', 'negative', 'plane', 'distance']"
Coordinates of a Point In a Plane, we know that every point can be assigned an number on ar number line to define its position but do you know how to define the position of a point in he plane we know that to define the position of a point in he plane we need are two dimensional cartesian plane this plane is divided into four codons by two mutually perpendicular axes ex and why the two mutually perpendicular axes to intersect each other at zero called origin on the ex axes positive numbers are shown on the right of zero and negative numbers are shown on the left of zero similarly on the vyaxes positive numbers are shown above the zero and negative numbers are shown below the zero the position of apoint in acartisian plane is defined by a pair of numbers say ex why this pair of numbers is known as the cordinates of that point the number ex is known as excordinate or abscissa plural of absessa is abscissa and the number of vi is known as why cordinate or ordinate plural of ordinate is ordinates here it should be noted that the coordinates is an ordered pair of numbers it means that the first number of the cordinates is always the excordnates and the second number is always the vi cornte this cannot be vice versa so the cordinates of a point is an ordered pair of numbers here ex is the perpendicular distance of the point from the vyaxces and why is the perpendicular distance of the point from the exaxes lets discuss in detail the procedure finding the podnates of a point in a cartesian plane with the help of an exumber find the cordinates of the given point air as we just discuss that the cord,"['ex axes positive numbers', 'perpendicular axes ex', 'number ex', 'positive numbers', 'cartesian plane', 'perpendicular axes', 'number', 'vi cornte', 'ordered pair', 'abscissa plural', 'plane', 'numbers', 'perpendicular', 'ex', 'plural', 'vi', 'abscissa', 'pair', 'point']"

Linear Equations and Their Solutions, you have already learnt about linear equations an equation in which the highest power of the variable is one is called al linear equation for example consider the equation ex plus seven is equal to to tan here seven and fifteen are constons an ex is the unknown or the variable some examples of linear equations in one variable are shown here the value of the variable that max an equation are true statement is called its solution in other words there are certain values of the variable for which the expressions on the left hand side and the right can side of an equation are equal these walls are the solutions of the equation alien ar equation in one variable has a unique solution we have also learnt how to represent the solution of alien ar equation on ar number line consider an equation two explathree is equal to zero exsolution that is the root of the equation is ex equal to negative three upon to this can be represented on the number line are shown here note that the solution of alien ar equation is not affected when the same number is added to or subtracted from both sides of the equation we can also multiply or divide both the sides of the equation by the same non yo number consider as situation the charges per over of planar game of boling is shown in the table it is shown that for every other two hundred if to requis will be care to the player thus the amount to be equate the pens on the amount of time spent by the player thus the calculation of the charges follow or particular patan the player will be charged an amount equal

Smooth Surface, friction on smooth surface friction always arises whenever there is a relative motion between the two objects its magnitude depends on the nature of the two surfacas in contact friction is less on smooth surface as compared to rough surface this is the reason that it is easier to push the box on smooth surface due to less irregularities than on rough surface which offars more friction due to more irregularities,"['surface friction', 'more friction', 'more irregularities', 'surface', 'friction', 'irregularities', 'relative']"
Rough Surface, friction on rough surface rough surface possess many irregularities in the form of holes and cracks which are sometimes even not visible to naked eyes rough surface is off ar more friction as compared to smooth surface as the moving ball stops after covering some distance even when no force is applied on it this is because the magnitude of frictional force offered by the rough surface is more than the applied force,"['rough surface rough surface', 'eyes rough surface', 'rough surface', 'surface', 'many', 'friction']"
Water Cycle, do we drink the same water to day that the dine for is drink when they were alive yes you would be amazed to know that the water on our earth is the same water that has been here for nearly five billion years the earth does not get new water every time it rains that rain is actually the same water that was in forms lakes and oceans several days back so outer the water go from being in ocean to falling down as rain it is through the water cycle which is known as hydrological cycle the water re cycles over and over again or we can say it is constantly moving this movement is called water cycle or hydrological cycle remember the date amount of water within the cycle remains constant but its distribution between different processes continuously changes many processes are involved in the water cycle and the most important are evaporation transpiration condensation precipitation and collection the water in oceans lakes rivers borns or streams evaporates becaus of the heat of the sun plants also add large amount of waves in the atmosphere through transpiration water vapours in the air rise up as the air higher up in the atmosphere is cooler it goes the water vapour and condenses phe to form water droplets many such tiny water droplets together form clouds this processes called condensation when the condensed water drops become too heavy the fall back to the earth in the form of rain hail sleeve snow this is called precipitation rain water gets collected in oceans lakes rivers or on land this processes called collection some of the rain water evaporates back into the atmosphere by the process of evaporation and transpiration while some of it passes through the soil into the non porous rocks beneath and becomes available to us as ground water ground water is the so of many lakes open wells are fed by the ground water water drawn by the few bells and hand pumps is actually ground water the rain that falls on land flows into rivers through streams most of the rivers flow into sea and ocean after covering along distans water from some rivers flows into lakes also snow in the mountains melts during summer into water this water flows down the mountains in the form of streams and rivers as we all are aware that the water from ocean and surface of earth goes into atmosphere as waper and returns as rain hall sleeve or snow rain water or water flows on an mountains sooner or later returns to the oceans in different ways the circulation of water in this manner is known as water cycle thus we can say that water cycle is the constant circulation of water from the earth to the atmosphere and back to the earth the different processes involved in the water cycle are evaporation transpiration condensation precipitation and colletion,"['water water', 'rain water', 'transpiration water', 'water cycle', 'water flows', 'water', 'many lakes open', 'lakes rivers borns', 'lakes rivers', 'constant circulation', 'mountains melts', 'rivers flows', 'streams most', 'land flows', 'hand pumps', 'few bells', 'air rise', 'sun plants', 'rain', 'many', 'lakes', 'porous', 'amount', 'several', 'transpiration', 'sleeve', 'different', 'cycle', 'circulation', 'mountains', 'rivers', 'land', 'air', 'streams', 'most', 'constant']"
Human Heart, are you familiar with this sound what is it this is the sound our heart mats as it beads heart is the organ that leads us going but it keeps on beating continuously heart is the complex pumping organ which beats continuously for the transport of blood and the other substances throughout the body what do you think and any pump work for years without stopping yes it seems impossible but our heart words like apomnounetop and efficiently let us know about this energetic an amazing organ in detail place your palm or little to the left side of your chest cavity yes here lies the heart the heart is of hollow muscular organ located in the chest cavity in between the two lands the lower tip of the heart is slight late tend towards the left of the mid line of the body made of was by holding of fingers in birds on your palm it represents the sides of the heart yes the heart is about the sides of ar fist our body contains two types of blood one is rich in oxygen and the other is rich in cavity of side pot if both tides mixes with each other in order to avoid this condition human heart is divided into four chambers the two upper chambers are called at tree and the two leechembers are called ventricles these chambers are separated by acetone in fact this septum held to avoid the making of both types of blood now you must be thinking that which side of the heart will contain oxygen rich blood and which side will contain car body outside which blood to get the answer of this query we should understand how are circulate system words during laterculation caveioxside rich blood from the whole body enters the right atrium of the heart as the right atrium is filled with blood it contracts the try cos pit wool opens and the blood is pumped into the right ventricle of the heart now as the right ventricle contracts the pulmonary wall opens and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary or tree which carries blood to the lungs for oxygenation the oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the left atrium of the heart through the pulmonary was when the left at rim is filled with oxygenated blood it contract and which will blood opens and blood is pumped into the left ventricle now left ventricle contracts and semilunar valves open the oxygenated blood is pumped into the aorta which distributes oxygenated blood to the rest of the body the chambers of heart are made up of cardiac muscles these muscles contract and relax in our specific sequence one complete cycle of this red the may contraction followed by its relaxation constitutes the heart beat heart beat continues throughout the life have you ever seen at doctor placing an instrument on the chest of ar person and carefully listening through it do you have any idea what is really going on inside ar doctor feeds the heart beat of the pation with the help of an instrument called states co this stethoscope is an divides which are the five the sound of the heart beat it is made up of ar chest peas which carries the sensitive di fragments or long rubber tube which joins the chest peas to the ear pieces now that is undertake as simple activity to know more about heart beat and pulse rate take afunnel of about six to seven centimetors in diameter and fix the rubber tube of about fifty centimetres let tightly on its stem stretch ar balloon on the mouth of the funnel and fix it tightly with the help of ar rubber band plays the mouth of the funnel on your chest lose to your heart and keep the open end of the tube on one of your years now try to listencarefully you can clearly year the pumping sound of your heart beat try to count your heart beat in resting state and also after running for five to ten minutes try this activity with your friends also do you have any idea how many times did you heart beats per minute number of beds per minute is called the pulse re it the rhythmic beating of the chambers of the heart facilitates blood circulation and transport of various substances throughout the body what do you think animals like forces and hydra also possess blood no these animals use sea water for transportation water supplies food and oxygen as it enters their body and it carries away was and carbon dioxide while leaving one more important fact that is worth discussing is that who discovered the process of blood circulation an english physician william harvay was the first to discover the circulation of blood through the body he proved that the heart acts as he pump which pushes the blood around the body through are trees and that the blood returns to the heart through the waves blood calculation is necessary to sustain the vital processes in multi cellular organisms because this extensive network supplies the cells to shoes and organs with oxygen and nutriens what removing carbon dioxide and was the maproducts of respiration the calculatory system has evolved over time from simple diffusion through cells to complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of the human body,"['ar rubber', 'caveioxside rich blood', 'ar chest', 'stretch ar', 'rich blood', 'complex pumping organ', 'ar', 'human body', 'semilunar valves open',

Water Management, do you know what the most abundant natural resources on our planet is yes it is water are all seventy one per cent of the earth surface is the word with water so out is known as of blue planet thus it is easy to think that water is plentiful however this notion is not true let us understand why there is aneed of water conservation well out of the total available water ninety seven per cent is salty water and only three per cent as fresh water out of the total amount of available fresh water nearly to per cent is in is caps and glaciers and only one per sent as available for human consumption we consume water for various purposes such as drinking cooking food cleaning utensils washing clothes rating rushing teeth at cetera so it is impossible to spend asingle day without water but have you ever wondered how this water reaches the taps of our houses well in most cities as well as towns water is supplied to the houses by the water supplies system that draws the water from nearby lakes bones wells and rivers this water reaches our homes through an network of ar well plant bi system however sometimes the water supply through pits by the seven bodies does not reach our houssays do you know the common reason behind this yes sometimes the water does not reach of destinationtu to leakage in water supply pits in this situation ar lot of water gushes out of the pin and is wastes since water is appressere source and very little water available on our planet is fit for human consumption it is the responsibility of civicathorities to take image at action and prevent the waste age of water what do you think is water management only the job of the silicathorities no along would civic authorities water and awation is the modal duty of every individual also as mis management and waste age of water take place even at the individual level to knowing ly or an knowing la but how does this waste age of water take place at the individual level well to understand it we call the incidents when your moment wise to you to close the tap while brushing your ti all note take long shares she tells the simple to conserve water the age of that and the houses is not the reason behind wasted of water also sometimes while washing clothes utensils houses we clothes at cetera we waste the water as if it is available in plenty and it supply would never end although it is not true the usable form of water is deleting at afastpays and the amount of water is less to meet the water related with wirements of our fast growing population industries and agriculture can you wily in list some of the other grave consequences of water scarcity yes water scarcity leads to loss of biodiversity diseases and humans and redused economy growth which leads to social instability and conflict so far we know that water is essential for us to carry out warious day to day activity but we must remember that an adequate supply of water is essential for the proper growth of plants as well to understand it let us know the effect of water scarcity on or fate plant for this activity take up potted plant do not water it for a few days you will observe that it will will and ultimately dry up this aces because plants require water to patch the new trains from the soil to prepare their food the effect of water scarcity on plants is grave because is the plants would face water scarcity they would die and this would directly effect all other life forms as there would be no food and no oxygen moreover enough rain will not be received and problems like boil erosion would become comment now let us look at the measures that we can at top to increase the supply of fresh water and conserve water we all know that rainfall is the main phenomenon through which we receive most of the water is specially during the man soon season and it is the rainfall pattern that the sides water availability in various regions of the world however it is quite commonly seen that most of the rain water just flows in the trees this is the water that we can conserve and so ththewastage of this precious natural resources can be prevented the rain water can be used to re charge to the ground water through ar process known as rain water harvesting or simply water harvesting let us understand this process in detail rain water harvesting is at technique wave rain water is collected and stored for later usage the catchment for the water harvesting system is the surface that directly receives the rain fall and browide water to the rain water harvesting system rain water harvesting is mainly carried out through the roof top rain water harvesting matherd the most basic form of roof to harvesting in walls the collection of rain water in as simple vessel kept at the roof sags the more complex and widely used mated of roof top harvesting in most the collection of rain water using sloping of the roof through watater and as series of fits another technique of rain water harvesting is the collection of rain water flowing into the roadside trains rain water flowing into roadside rains as allowed to flow in deep pits waters told in the pits recharges the ground water table let us now discuss ice study of rain water harvesting practistin gigrarwoge for region in catch of guard receives eratic rain fall thus the only fresh water so is ground water as water is not available in the rivers throughout the year however as the water demand has increased in recent years the water table has red used that an alarming rate therefore the villages along way non governmental organisation work together for conserving water eighteen check dams work constructed on rocmavaty river and its tribute rays this help and increasing the porcelation of water into the soil and recharged the aquefers due to awareness and combine the fires of people now the well in this area contain water also the water that flow into the sea and was of no use to people is now available for irrigation another successful initiative of water harvesting comes from rates tan which is a hot and dry plays this region faces the challenge of water scarcity thus agroup of social waters has world towards transforming are dry area in the ulverdistric into green plays the belt water harvesting structures to conserve water there refer it has held to revive dried up rivers like aware cerci ruparil pagany and gerasvaly thus water harvesting is one of the most promising alternatives for supplying fresh water and meat its increasing demand moreover it is interesting to no that indians have been grade water harvested for ages there are traditional practices that are common in in tea for water storage and ground water re charges like bars let us discuss it in detail bore is the traditional meter of collecting water in waters and these are the deep wells dug in the ground and have steps to reach the stone water these structures help an storing the water for along time as the evaporation rate from the deep well is very low this quite being the useful water storage means the use of varies reduced over time and these are as he western into the damping side where garbage started piling up however as water scarcity increase people of bees areas started re thinking to reused bars and so may refers to revive these resewiyers as he result even though the rainfall is scantyan these areas the water is availa ble to the people of these areas throughout the year do you know any other way to conserve water another method of water conservation is using trip irrigation as it is an economical method of using water in agriculture trip irrigation is an irrigation meter that uses the system of narrow to banks to allow dripping water on to the soil at the base of plants can we conserve water in our daily lives yes we can adapt the following practices in our daily lives to conserve water if we see any tap leaking in our houses schools or any place we were set we must take in each at action to stop the ligate and prevent water way stage some other ways of water conservation are turning off the taps while brushing avoiding over watering of gardens and flour ports mapping the floor instead of washing at these are some of the basic and easy measures that we can adopt to conserve water out of the total available water ninety seven per cent to salty water and only three per centers fresh water which is fit for human consumption water comes avation is the moral duty of every individual as mis management and way stage of water takes place even at the individual level either knowingly or unknowingly water scarcity leads to loss of biodiversity diseases in humans and reduced economy growth which leads to social instability and conflict various methods of water conservation are rain water harvesting check dams trip irrigation and traditional practices like conservation of water in bow rays thus it is important to conserve water and take appropriate steps to recharged ground water so that fresh water is available for human consumption as well as to the plants,"['rain water harvesting system rain water harvesting', 'top rain water harvesting', 'rain water

Frictional Force, frictional force have you ever thought why weak slows down on applying breaks not only weaker but any object slows down when moves over the surface of another object even when no external force is applied on it is means that there are some force that opposes the motion of one object over the other this opposing for is known as frictional force or friction,"['external force', 'frictional force', 'force', 'weak']"
Force - Introduction, in our daily life we see numerous activities around us on the basis of that let us try to guess the answer based on our common experience do you know what makes an object at rest begin to move what causes an object to accelerate or desire and what makes an object to move in a circular part yes of course the answer is force it is the force which makes the object to move or which brings the object to rest from motion force and motion ar actually interrelated in this chapter we are going to understand the connection between force and motion fore you must have observed many of the times you go for shopping in he mark where you need he grocery card what do you do to move a grocery card simply you push it and when your shopping is complete you go to exit door now what you open it you pull its handle so to over grocery card or to open the door you apply yes fore hence we can say that force is he kind of push or pull on an object is force only a push or pull well we have to find out now do one thing place of football on the ground what will you do to bring it into motion you will kick it similarly to stop it you may place your foot on to it now we can say that kicking hitting pushing pulling all these terms can be replaced with he single term and you guess it right force,"['motion force', 'grocery card', 'circular part', 'common experience', 'numerous activities', 'daily life', 'motion', 'force']"

Atoms, do you know what is the building block of an atom the building block of an anti is the small grain of sand look at the piece of paper you will be surprised to know that a sheet of paper may contain at least millions of atoms from these two examples it is clear that an atom is the building block of all matter it is the smallest particle of an element that takes part in ar chemical reaction in this table you can observe the relative sizes of were as atoms the state are clearly explains that an atom of hydrogen is the smallest atom atoms of the same element all different elements can join together to form molecules which in turn form most of the objects around us though atoms are insignificant in size yet they constantly affect us in whatever we do we may not be able to see them but they exist everywhere therefore in order to understand the nature of matter around us we need to learn about the atom,"['smallest atom', 'least millions', 'sand look', 'small grain', 'building block', 'form', 'chemical', 'smallest', 'atom', 'relative', 'element']"
Fluid Friction, you might have written bicycle against the wind on awindy day what will you experience you will experience that it is difficult to move the bicycle against the wind and it requires ar lot of afford similarly when as swimmer tries to move against the flu of river stream he faces the difficulty and has to apply more folds to move upstream in both the above cases the resistance against the motion is created due to the opposing force offered by the air and water this resistant force is called fluid friction before learning about fluid friction in dy tail let us first unders tand what fluids are liquids and gases are together called fluids because they can flow when an object tries to move through a fluid either liquid or gas its motion is opposed by the fluid this resistance offered by fluids to the motion of an object through it is cold fluid friction or drag drag folds of fluid friction acts in the direction opposite to the direction of motion of the object you can also experience the air drag while running against the wind on awindy day you will realise that you have to apply more folds while moving against the wind for similar reason or high speed motor more moving rapidly on seed experiences the frictional folds the magnitude of the fluid friction or drag depends on the following facts speed of the object shape of the object size of the object nature of fluid an aeroplane flying at as speed of one thousand culomiter for over will experience move fluid friction as compared to an arrow plain flying at speed of five hundred culomiters for over do you find any similarity between the shape of a bird and an aeroplane yes they both have as streamlined shape for objects to move through fluids they have to overcome the fluid friction acting on them in this process they lose energy efforts are therefore made to many mice friction so objects are given special shapes as streamlined body is pointed at the ends and brought in the middle this shape held in decreasing fluid friction when the object passes through afluid the fluid friction acting on an object while passing fhrugh a fluid increases with the size of the object for example if or car and at truck are moving at the same speed then the truck fill experience move fluid friction as compared to the card apart from the speed shape and size of the object fluid friction also depends on the nature of the fluid fluid the object is fussing do you know why it is easier to run in the air than to swim in water water offers move fluid friction as compared to air because water is thicker than air that is why it is more difficult to swim in water than to run in the air so in this animation we have learnt that,"['object fluid friction', 'fluid fluid', 'drag drag folds', 'speed shape', 'fluid friction', 'object shape', 'streamlined shape', 'speed', 'fluid', 'fill experience', 'mice friction', 'similar reason', 'direction opposite', 'unders tand', 'dy tail', 'resistant force', 'above cases', 'river stream', 'awindy day', 'object', 'folds', 'shape', 'drag', 'streamlined', 'experience', 'direction', 'force']"
Soil Erosion, soil erosion is the process of wearing away of the top soil due to natural factors like winds and flods or human activities like agriculture and farming practices it is and natural process there are three stages of soil erosion detachment of the fertile organic top soil this top soil there is then carried away to the far off places through foces like wind and floods and as the posited into various drained channels there are various causes of soil erosion which include deforestation which refers to the cutting and removal of forests over grazing by animals over use of pesticides and fertilisers damages the physical cometents of the soil rain votes also when of the main factors causing soil erosion land slides refer to the down hill movement of masses of soil leading to soil erosion floods is also one of the factors dander old soil effects of soil erosion soil erosion leads to decline in soil fertility loss of physical components of the soil this and turn decreases the agricultural productivity which in the larger scenario affect the overall economy of as state and the country therefore soil erosion is an extremely wasteful process and steps should be taken to pruentit,"['soil erosion soil erosion', 'soil erosion land', 'organic top soil', 'soil erosion', 'soil fertility', 'soil rain', 'top soil', 'soil', 'natural process', 'natural factors', 'various causes', 'farming practices', 'human activities', 'hill', 'physical', 'factors', 'process', 'agricultural', 'various']"

Human Circulatory system, our body remains active through the day and night even when we sleep to to the non of action of of very important organ can you guess what it is we shall now study about it our heart is like house which for rooms and many dolls acting in such ago ordinate fashion such that blood enters and leaves each room through the respected balls in poor fiction tiny and timing we shall first see how the flow of blood is manished in the heart from bodchambod to another and then see how the walls of heart contract and expand to allow the flow ori or atria are also known as the receiving chambers and ventricles are known as the conducting chambers the heart consists of four chambers let us say they are four rooms to bigger ventricles and to smaller races pumping of heart axile veins that these chambers contract and expand in withem to allow movement of blood through the heart how does blood move from bonchambod to another there are dolls name walls which ween through light sight chambers and og left side chambers there is no mixing of blood in right side with the blood in left side you will shortly chewie the walls can open only towards one way the walls between the right oricle and ventricle is known as the racaspit walls as the walls between left ori fl and ventricle is known as the bookaspid or mitral walls let us see the location of openings through which blood enters the heart blood enters heart through batchanels known as veins they articblood vessels which have walls in side them to prevent blood flow of blood inferior win cava are great veins which bring blood from lower body part through the right oricle to be rear vena cava are the great veins which ring blood from the up of body through the right oricle pulmonary veins bring blood through the heart from both the lungs can you give bone difference between blood in vena cava and blood in pulmonary veins let us now see how blood leave the heart the ventricles or the conducting chambers which conduct blood from hard through the rest of the body the openings of ventricles from blood conduction are also blooded bowalls to prevent backflow blood is carried away from heart to organs by great arteries the pulmonary art the void in to pulmonary arteries and conduct blood from the right ventricle through the lungs this opening is garded ba the pulmonacwals the load is artery of the body our to carries blood from left ventricle through the rest of the body the opening in this case is coated by the our take walls now we know about the parts of our heart let us see hear it words if we start blood from the entry of the oxygenated blood from body part we have to look at the right oricle the the oxygenated blood is shown in blue and oxygenated blood is shown in red when the heart relates the vena cava brine blood to the right oricle the pulmonary veins are the special veins which carry oxygenated blood and the posed them in the left article of heart there are two receiving openings in the left oricle from either lungs after this the oriclescon heart to let the blood queens to the immediate outlet the ventricles this flow aces through cos pit walls as soon as the blood has entad ventricles the walls snatclals with pressure of blood volume in ventricles and back flow is prevented this generates the first heart sound loop after arcs have empty their blood in to ventricles they relats allowing farther flow of blood from great veins starting another are the at sickle right away blood pressure in ventricles and contraction of ventricles for out blood from them in through the great arteres as soon as the ventricles have conducted their blood through the arteries the semi lunar walls mats shut to prevent back flow this generates the second heart sound dub the ventricles relate immediately after this and blood can again flow in from the atria which have received blood from veins by now let us take an look at the actual heart now the heart is a muscular organ this is across section through heart revealing all the chambers and the vessels note the muscular walls try to tract the parts and openings of the great veins and great arteries you will see the actual positions of the great veins now note the positions of superior and inferior vena cava the upper chambers are oricles as you have learnt by now the blood from body parts come via vena cava and that from lungs come by the pulmonary veins can you say how does the blood become the oxygenated in body cells and oxygenated in lungs these are also known as the oriculor ventricular walls which card the opening between the oricles and ventricles note that though the blood in oricles and ventricles of the same side can makes among each other blood of right side and left side of heart does not ever mix the chambers are separated by athickseptum the ventricles are provided with athicker muscular wall thand the atria one reason for this is they have to pump the blood really heart so that it gains enough potential to reach the remotestcapulary in the body do you now understand the necessity of keeping the heart lean and healthy the right ventricle conducts the oxygenated blood to the two lungs wire the pulmonary artery the heart pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins work together to form the pulmonary circulatory system our tear is the largest artery which carries oxygenated blood from left ventricle and distributes it to the entire body of the branching and re branching you know by now that the right side of heart contains the oxygenated blood and left side contains oxygenated blood the heart supplies oxygenated blood to all parts of the body and brings back the oxygenated blood from all parts of the body to lungs for oxygenation,"['heart blood', 'heart pulmonary', 'dolls

Blood and Blood Vessels, every year twenty nine septemper is celebrated as world or days it dams to prevent car you vascular diseases that take the lives of seventeenpoint nine million people every year and accounts for fatty one per cent of all global deaths do you know how det or cars with in minutes and case of apart arrest in cot arrest the heart is unable to pump blood and death occurs with in minutes if left untreated have you were thought why blood is so potent for our body to get the answer of this question we must know what exactly blood is and what is its role in our body let us find out blood is he badly fluid which circulates through the human body in the blood vessels it runs forts new trains from the digestive system to the other parts of the body it carries oxygen from the lungs and provides it to the cells of the body it also transports waste plots such as urea for removal from the body now when may think that how is the blood carry so many substances to know the answer let us know about the various components of blood blood is the fluid having different types of cells suspended in it the fluid part of the blood is known as plasma and the cellular component comprises of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets have you ever bonded why blood peers red in colour red blood cells for or by seas contain are red colored pigment known as hemoglobin which is responsible for imparting red colour to the or bases the hemoglobin binds we oxygen and forms axe hemoglobin it carries the oxygen to all parts of the body and finally delivers it to all the cells white blood cells all the lub sees play are row in the defense mechanisms of the body they fight against germs which enter our body you and your friends must have pollen many times while playing sometimes you get an minor injury while other times blood stars woosing out from the injured area but after a short while bleeding stops and the dark red flat appears at the site of injury have you were out what is it here comes the role of the third cellular component of the blood that is platelets platelets are responsible for blood plotting in band blood always flows in flows to vessels and tubes throughout the body this is called flows circle try system what do you think are all the blood vessels alike now blood has to transport oxygen from the lungs to various parts of the body also it has to pace carbon dioxide from various parts of the body and deliver it to the lungs for its removal from the body blood on the basis of the transportation of oxygenated and de oxygenated blood there are two types of blood vessels present in our body these are or traits and ways or trees carry oxgenated blood fa way from the heart to body parts the blood in four trees flows under high pressure generate in by the contraction of heart mussels therefore the or trees have thick and elastic walls let us undertake an activity to understand the flow of blood through the our trees place the middle and index finger of your right hand on the in our side of your left rays do you feel any compang or proving movements do you have any idea what is really going on inside why do we feel about at the rest it is do you to the blood flowing in the our traits try to count the number of pars beats permanent perform this activity with your classmates also number of beats for minutes call the false rays in resting condition falls rate ranges from seventy to to eighty beats permanete wants carry the oxygenated blood from all parts of the body towards the heart the wants possess pain balls as the blood flow is not and out pressure in away they possess balls so why do we need these walls we need walls to prevent the back flow of blood what very interesting fact worth discussing here is that the name of pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein is misnomer let us find out how pulmonary or try carries blood away from the heart so it is coldand our try on the other hand falminary van carries blood to word the heart so it is called owing here it is important to note that pulmonary artery carries the oxygenated blood while pulmonary vein carries oxygenated blood arteries divide many times into smaller arteriole which again sub divides finally to form the smallest vessels called capillaries the networks of capillaries join to form when mule which further forms the veins now you must be thinking what capillaries do the capillaries are the side where the actual diffusion of oxygen carbon dioxide nutrients etcetera takes place in normal course of circulation the blood from the heart flows through artery to reach the capillary bed and from there through wins it returns back to the heart this extensive network supplies oxygen and nutrients to the cells the shoes and organs and removes carbon

Blood Circulatory System, the heart the blood and the blood vessels make up asystem for the transport of gases new trains and chemical ways in animals the heart circulate blood to all body parts to blood vessels blood vessels allow oxygenated blood and neutrons to reach the tissues and was to be removed from the tissues there are three basic types of blood vessels in the human body take void are trees carry oxygen rich blood away from the heart in void veins return oxygen to blood to the heart tiny capillaries can it arteries to veins to form of closed circulatory system capillaries allow the exchange of materials between blood and the surrounding tissue because of their thin walls and large service area are trees and veins are much larger than the capillaries this junction is called capillary bed,"['circulatory system capillaries', 'rich blood', 'tiny capillaries', 'basic types', 'chemical ways', 'service', 'body', 'new', 'blood', 'capillaries']"
Blood Circulation, let us compare blood circulation in different organisins flow of blood within the body is called blood circulation there are two types of blood circulation and wordebrades single blood circulation and double blood circulation in single blood circulation blood passes rough the heart bonds for example fish in fresh the heart has two chambers one atrium and one ventricle the wins carried the the oxygenated blood into the thin walled atrium the atrium generates the contractions to as to push blood into the ventricle the ventricle pumps blood inside it into the thin walled gills gills are the primary respiratory organs of fish the gills facilitate exchange of gases that is an axon of oxygen from water and elimination of carbon dioxide arteries carry the oxygenated blood from the gills throughout the body in double blood crculation blood passes through the heart twice for example amphibian frog birds mammals for example elephant amphibian heart is three tchamberd that is to atria and one ventricle asingelatrium is divided into two separate chambers oxygen rich blood from the lungs enters one atrium and the oxygenated blood enters the other atrium both the atria empty into single ventricle when ventrical contracts oxygen rich blood is pumped to the body tissues while the oxygenated blood is sent to lungs and skin for oxygenation in birds and mammals the heart is for chamber that is two atria and to ventricle the atria and uentrical ar divided into two separate chambers practically forming two hearts one pumps oxygen rich blood to the body and one pump the oxygenated blood to the lungs veins carry the oxygenated blood it carries blood from the body pot to the heart or tries carry oxygenated blood it carries blood from heart to other part of the body,"['contracts oxygen rich blood', 'chambers oxygen rich blood', 'oxygen rich blood', 'example amphibian frog birds', 'single blood', 'blood', 'walled atrium', 'amphibian heart', 'other atrium', 'single ventricle', 'walled', 'oxygen', 'dioxide', 'respiratory', 'body', 'organisins', 'example', 'other', 'atrium', 'ventricle', 'chambers', 'birds', 'heart', 'atria']"

Writing Chemical Formula, to day they are roughly six thousand fi hundred languages spoken around the world ar formal language consists of words combined to form sentences ar word is formed when several alphabets are combined together to produce of particular sound that they not something in the same way when symbols of different elements are combined with certain rules and laws they form ar chemical formula the chemical formula of or compound is as symbolic representation of its composition it is also known as molecular formula it indicates the number of atoms of each of the constituent elements present in wombolicule of or compound the chemical formula of the molecular formula of or compound can be determined from the known valencies of the constituent elements but do you know what is valency whalency is the combining capacity of an element in ar compound somelemens show modanvon valence the valency of an element is indicated by the requisite romannumeral within braces valency of the constituent elements help in writing the chemical formula of the compound now how can you determine the chemical formula of the molecular formula of or compound if the valencies of its constituent elements are known the answer is the criss cross mated in the criss cross method first we identify the constituent elements are ions of the compound and ride their symbols here is the cable of various ions and the symbols used for them now we will study about the rules which are used in writing the chemical formula of the compound rule on the positive charge on the cation must be balonstba and equal and oppositardr of the anion rule to the name or symbol of the metal line or cation is written first on the laid while the name of the non metal line or anion is written on the rid side for example calcium chloride copper oxide at seta rule try in compounds formed with polyatomic cans the polyatomic ion is in closed inabracet before writing the number to indicate the ratio bracket is not required when the polyatomic ion is wound say the symbols are and be then we will the symbol of each element we ride their valence let the valency be ex and vi for be and be respectively after this we cross multiply the valencies to obtain the number of atm of the constituent elements in the molecule of the compound now write the formula of the compound obtained by criss cross mated we must make sure that the number of constituent atoms in the final molecular formula is the smallest possible whole number for this we divide the formula obtained by as suitable number now we will on the stand the method of writing the chemical formula with the help of somexompals beginning with the chemical formula of carbon tail come dark side is formed by combining carbon and oxygen the symbol of carbon is and that of oxygen is on the valency of carbon and oxygen is for and two respectively cross multiply the valency of carbon and oxygen to obtain the number of atoms of the constituent elements in the molecule of the compound thus the formula of camula say cos to be see two or for the number of constituent atoms in the final molecular formula should be the smallest possible whole number they are for on dividing by to we get the chemical formula of the compound as so to now we will find out the chemical formula of hydrogen sulphide hydrogens al fit is formed by combining hydrogen and alpha the symbol of hydrogen is age and that of sale is as the valencies of hydrogen and salfa are van and two respectively cross multiply the valenscy of hydrogen and sulpha thus the formula of hydrogen al phy as eight to sand or eight to is the next chemical form pond we have is calcium hydroxide it is formed by combining calcium and hydroxidns the valencies of calcium and hydroxidins are two and von respectively on cross multi plain the chemical formula of calcium hydroxide comes out to be see oatwo here the bracket around og indicate that there of two hydroxidens attached to one cal she main brackets are used when there are two or more of the sea min in the formula similarly we can determine the chemical formula of magnetium chloride the symbol of the metlatum forming the catan is written first followed by the non metalatum forming the and their respective valencies are written below the symbols finally on applying the criss cross method we get the formula of magnetium chloride now can you determine the chemical formula of carbon tetrachloride carbon tetrachloride is formed by combining carbon and lurinatums the symbol of carbon is sa and that of chlorine is cell the valency of carbon is for and that of chlorine is one cross multiply the valency of carbon and chlorine the chemical formula of carbon tetrachloride thus comes out to be sa von

Respiration, we always eat food whenever we feel hungry why do we feel hungry after regular interval of time it is because food provides us energy for all the life processes hence we feel hungry on regular bases as to supply of energy to the body cells now let us discuss hour food provides us energy it is possible due to ap process known as respiration it is the biochemical process in which the body cells break down glucose molecules in the presence of oxygen to release energy the nutrients from our food get absorbed in to the but stream and combine with oxygen to release energy during cellular respiration cellular respiration can be further divided into two types aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration let us drive into their details one by one usually or body cells undergo aerobic mode of respiration in this mode food components are broken down in the presence of oxygen to liberate large amount of energy its end products are carbon dioxide and water on the other hand in the absence of adequate amount of oxygen the food components cannot combine with oxygen completely to yield energy as he result alcohol and carbon dioxide or an organic acid lac lactic acid are formed as the end products this type of respiration produces less energy than the aerobic respiration anaerobic respiration occurs in yeast cells and the cells are set to be enerobes they produce alcohol as one of the end product that is why they are used in brury industry during excessive exercise our muscle cells start respiring in the absence of oxygen to meet the instant requirement of energy but in this case lactic acid gets accumulated in the muscle cells and causes muscle grams muscle cramps are the sudden and involuntary constructions of muscle cells that cause pain once sufficient amount of oxygen becomes available lactic acid combines with oxygen to release carbon dioxide and water it is interesting to know that how we can get relief from the cramps by taking hot water bath or masage it is because hot water bath or masage increases the circulation of blood which restores the oxygen supply of the muscle cells try to do some breathing exercise like proniam to live ahealthy live,"['muscle cells', 'lactic acid', 'aerobic respiration', 'mode food', 'aerobic mode', 'oxygen supply', 'other hand', 'carbon dioxide', 'glucose molecules', 'life processes', 'amount', 'muscle', 'cells', 'food', 'respiration', 'exercise', 'water', 'end', 'process', 'regular', 'acid', 'oxygen', 'supply', 'energy']"

Velocity, speed of a body tells us how fast or slower body is moving it doesn tell us about the direction in which he body is moving on the other hand the velocity of an object is a quantity that gives the speed of the object as well as its direction of the motion suppose the distance between the two towns when travelled through curved road is one twenty culometers and the time taken by the gy to cover disdistances two hours but the displacement of the card between the two towns is hundred celometers so speed of the car is given by distance travelled divided by the time taken which is equal to sixteculomiter per are but the velocity of the car is given by displacement divided by the time taken that is and regulomiter divided by two hours which is equal to fifty culomiters per hour if we divide the magnitude of displacement by the time taken we will obtain the velocity of the body along the given direction so we can define velocity as the displacement of the object for unit time the exiunit of elocity is the same as that of speed that is meter per secon when abody travels and straight lime in a particular direction and covers equal distance in equal interval of time it is said to have uniform velocity thus abody travelling with constant speed along or straight line in aorticular direction as uniform velocity when a body does not cover equal distances in equal intervals of time or change its direction at regular intervals the velocity of the body is said to be non uniform all variable velocity are moving on ar soclar track is the example of non uniform or variable velocity average velocity if the velocity of abody in a poticular direction changes continuously at he uniform rate then the mean of the initial and final velocity over a given period of time is called the average velocity in that direction,"['uniform velocity', 'equal intervals', 'direction', 'equal', 'straight line', 'straight lime', 'velocity', 'soclar track', 'constant speed', 'unit time', 'other hand', 'slower body', 'regular intervals', 'uniform', 'time', 'body', 'speed']"
Velocity and Acceleration, we locate and acceleration in our everyday life we see motion of different objects some of them move fast and are move slow but on who base is do we decide the slow and fast motion of the objects lets it suppose to cover is certain distant say hundred colometers to cars made same amount of time or the may take different on to time but the car which states listed in the core the same distances faster we rate at which objects move can be are non but is there any rate through it we can measure the rate of motion of the objects yes its speed which is the fat as the distance travelled fine object for in time speed can be measured in colometer or our by the asiunit of speed is meter per second in most of the cases objects are in non uniform motion or we cannot of say that speed of the objects meet of the constant so in such bases we despite rate of motion of such objects by dividing the total distance travelled with the total time taken this is called average speed of the object suppose of car travels to distance of hundred colometers in two hours its average speed is fifty culometer or hour but the car might not have travelled at fifty colometof or our all the time but from this example to we get any information about the direction the car is travelling in no the rate of motion of an object can be more comprehensive if we specify its direction of motion along with its speed and the parsityy that pateies for the features is called velocity velocity of teloject is express as the displacement of an object for in at time now the car takes to turn towards ease while slowing down as well as changing the direction of motion it can be concluded that the velocity of an object can be changed by changing the object speed direction of motion or both if the same car moves along the straight path at variable speed then the magnitude of its rate of motion can be expressed in terms of average velocity which is calculated in the same way as we calculate average speed but if the velocity of the object change is at the uniform rate then how is the are velocity calculated in that case the average velocity is given by the cart meticmean of in each of velocity and final velocity for the given period of time if the car moving in von direction on as straight road court equal distances in equal intervals of time then the change in velocity of the car for any time interval is beta but if the span car moves on road have in speed greater is its motion is non in can at several places and hence its velocity were is wet time thus the change in velocity of the car during those time intervals as an obsedo but is there any way to it restore of change in the velocity of an object yes it can by rest to way the aortitycalled acceleration excileration is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time if the magnitude of velocity is increasing its cart axile rated motion and if the magnitude of velocity is decreasing then its called the sale rated motion the is ordinate of acceleration is matter for second were axile ration can be positive as velasanegative you can easily and distant is with the help of or simple cases tide starting from as stationary position the cavity of velocity of its rate of per secant in party seconds now the driver applies the rates at that the velocity of the car comes down to for meter per second in the next five seconds by using the simple formal of acceleration we can easily know about positive anti negative acceleration if the car is travelling along the straight road and its speed increases by unequal amounts in equal intervals of time then the car at set to be m owing with non uniform acceleration on the other hand if an object travels in a straight line and its velocity increases or decreases by equal amounts in equal intervals of time then the acceleration of the object is said to be uniform,"['object speed direction', 'straight road court equal', 'time speed', 'same car', 'anti negative acceleration', 'uniform acceleration', 'total time', 'cases objects', 'uniform motion', 'speed', 'equal amounts', 'velocity velocity', 'simple cases', 'such objects', 'straight road', 'time', 'car', 'uniform', 'other hand', 'party seconds', 'stationary position', 'axile ration', 'cart axile', 'several places', 'cart meticmean', 'certain distant', 'everyday life', 'object', 'same', 'equal', 'straight', 'objects', 'acceleration', 'velocity', 'simple', 'such', 'motion', 'total', 'amounts', 'direction', 'road', 'seconds', 'distant']"

Uniform Circular Motion and Centripetal Force, the motion of earth around the sun or the motion of moon around the earth is along the circular path during the motion the speed of move the earth and the moon along their path is uniform however the direction of motion changes continuous late such type of circular motion where the speed of an object remains uniform but the direction changes continuously is called uniform circular motion can you think of one example o uniform circular motion as stone which is tied to arrow and is being son in circles is an example of uniform circular motion the direction of motion of an object at any instant of time is along the tangent to ar circular path at that instant but can you think what keeps the object to move in he circular path yes its the centripetal force that is centre seeking force if this force on an object in as circular motion vanishes the object flies off in the tangential direction lets understand about uniform circular motion and centripetal force in detail starting with uniform circular motion suppose and at let runs with the uniform speed along the rectangular track in every round changes his direction of motion at for corners of this rectangular track in order to keep himself on the track he quickly changes his speed at the corners when he runs on an hecigular tract then in every round he changes his position six times at six corners if the track is the regular octagan then in every round he has to change his position eight times at at corners and so on but what would happen to the shape of the tract if we go on increasing the number of sides in deulatly the shape of the track approaches the shape of he circle and the length of each of the sides will decrease to point now in the circle the at lead has to change his direction of motion at each point hence the effective direction of motion is along the tangent to the circular path at that point if the at lead moves with the elocity of constant magnitude along the circular path the only change in his velocity is due change in the direction of motion thus motion of the athlete moving along the circular path is an example of an accelerated motion if the at la takes peas sections to go on once around the circular path of radius art then its welocitywa is equal to circumfents of circular path divided by tea so when an object moves in acircular path with uniform speed its motion is called unifong circular motion lets do as simple activity to on the stand the uniform circular motion take apece of string and tie small piece of stone at one of its ends move the stone to the scar the circular path with constant speed by holding the thread at the other end can you guess the direction in which the stone moves if the string is released it will move tangentially at the point from where it is released repeat the activity and release the string at different positions of the circular path what do you notice the direction in which the stone moves in each case is different but moves along the straight line tangential to the circular path but why does this happen this is because once the scing is released the stone continues to move along the direction it has been moving at that instant that now understand what keeps an object in circular motion in the previous example of stone the change in the direction of motion of the stone and vaults change in will of city or acceleration of the stone the external force that cos is the acceleration and keeps the stone moving uniformly along the circular path is acting towards the centre of the circular path this is called centrpeatal force that is enter seeking force at any instant if we release the string the stone fly is along the tangent to the circular path at that instant so why does this happen this happens because the moment the string is released centripetal force is no longer provided the stone this we can perceived that motion of moon around the earth is due to centripetal force provided by the force of attraction of the earth on the moon similarly as all the planets of our sooner system revolve around the earth centripetal force must be acting on each planet provided by force of attraction of the sun on the planet ,"['uniform circular motion', 'circular motion', 'motion changes', 'centripetal force', 'circular path', 'direction changes', 'tangential direction', 'constant speed', 'late such', 'line tangential', 'uniform speed', 'small piece', 'simple activity', 'radius art', 'peas sections', 'regular octagan', 'hecigular tract', 'rectangular track', 'motion', 'force', 'direction', 'system', 'change', 'changes', 'constant', 'path', 'speed', 'uniform', 'activity', 'other', 'tract', 'track', 'stone', 'example']"

Perimeter and Area of a Triangle, you must be familiar we triangular shapes there are many objects around us which are in shape of ar triangle look around you and you may observe the shape in the great pyramids of eg this table clock wooden shells sand wet paper we set square wooden hang we know atriangle is aclosepolegon which consists of three sides and three angles what is the area and perimeter of any triangular shape let us learn it as we discussed perimeta of atudamentional shape is the distance along its ban grade it can be calculated by adding the lens of all the sides of the given shape so perimeter of any triangle abc is sum of all its three sides that is ab plus bc plus set however we can derive specific formulas for specific triangles like the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is three times the length of its side as all the sides of an equilateral triangle are equal similarly since in an ice of sales triangle two sides are equal its perimeter cangbecalculated as twice the length of equal sides plus the length of the third side now let us learn how matsurf it is ofcupide by any triangular shade or in other words we shall learn how to calculi the area of ar triangle though we have discussed how to get the area of ar triangle by the severing ar rectangle along its tangle in this way we get the area of ar triangle equals half of the product of length and breadth of the rectangle in case of area of a triangle instead of writing length and breadth we replace these two terms by base and hide so area of ar triangle can be interpreted as half of the product of its base and hide can we applied this formula for any triangle let us check it since all we angles in erectangle are of nantydegrades after the severing it along its triangle we get atriangle in which one of its angles as nantydegrees and hence the triangle as ar right angled triangle that means in case of right angle triangle we can use this formula what is we have an acute angle or an obtuse angled triangle let us explore it with the help of an active tape take ar sheet of paper ap pencil and are rule draw atriangle of any measurement on ar sheet of or paper cut out this triangle now place this triangle on another sheet of paper and cut out another triangle of same measures you can observe that both these triangles are congruen now place these triangles in such away that appear of corresponding sides is joint what figure have you got here its aparlelogram is nt at we know that the area of apalelogram is the product of the lengths of its base and hide here palelogram is formed by combining two triangles so area of palelogram equals the sum of the areas of these two triangles it would not be wrong to say that these two triangles are congruen this superimposed each ate and occupy same ba so we can say that twice the area of triangle one is same as the area of the palelogram but we know that the area of apalelogram is the product of its base and hide therefo the area of the triangle equals half of the product of length of its base and hide here it should be noted that the base and height of the palellogram are also the base and height of the triangle respective la what is the difference between both the derive former ly they both are same do you know for acute an obtuse angled triangles which side should be can sidled as base what would be there heights can it ring an acute angle triangle we can assume any of its sides as its respective bases place the triangles on ar flat surface along any of its side identify the vertex which does not at the at surfaes and from that word ix draw up appendicular to the base of the triangle the length of this perpendicula is known as the hit of the triangle in acute angle triangles height is inside the triangle in oppose angled triangles height is outside the triangle ut the formula for calculating the area remains the same do you know that this formula for finding the area of atriangle can further be converted into another one to find the area of an equilateral triangle let us scored when all sides of atriangle are equal it is known as an equilateral triangle let the side of an equilateral triangle abc b from vertex draw up appendicular am on to the opposite side bc obviously am is the altitude of the height of the triangle abc we know that for an equilateral triangle altitude is also its median thus mdividesbc into two equal parts so we m equal mc which is again equal to a upon to consider the triangle am using patagaras therum we get msquared plus mc squared equals ac squared on substituting the values of ac and mc we get am squared plus upon two whole square equals squared on solving it further we get am equals square root of three trans upon to we have height and length of the base of the triangle we know that the area of atriangle can be obtained by tating half of the product of its base and height on substituting the values of base and height we get the area of the triangle abc as square root of three times squared upon four thus the area of an equilateral triangle can also be calculated using the formula square root of three times side squared upon four to reinforce the concept of area of atriangel let us discuss an example look at this wooden wall hanging the length of side on which three status are placed is thirty centimetres and height from the point it is hang is eighteen centimetre calculate the area occupied on the wall by this wooden wall hanging as this wooden wall hanging is triangular in sa we know that the area of a triangle can be obtained by taking half of product of its base and height so area can be calculated by substituting the values of length of base of hanging and its height on solving it further we get that the area occupied on the wall by this wooden wall hanging is two hundred and seventy centimetre squared,"['ar triangle look', 'ar triangle', 'angle triangle', 'square wooden', 'angled triangle',

Right-Angled Triangle and Pythagoras Property, we are already aware with right angle triangles but do you know there is an important property of term related to right angle triangles which was found by ar great philosopher and mathematician pitagres he was born in six century at agree angle called samos before discussing about the her am of patanglles let talk about right angle triangles ar right angle triangle is the triangle that has one angle measuring ninety degrees large side of or right angled triangle is called hypotenus and other sides are called legs if bc is a right angle triangle with the measure of angle be at ninety degrees then as is hypotenuse and ab and bc are legs of this right angle triangle not is that hypotenuse is as side opposite to angle measuring ninety degrees lets stock about the pightangres erum it says that in a right angle triangle square of hypotenuse is equal to some of the squares of legs lets understand this property through an activity for this we will make eight right angle triangles of side lengths ex why and zd quarezad is the length of hypotenus of eight triangle take two square frames of side expleswie plays for triangles in aframe in this manner plays other for triangles in other in this manner both the frames or same in size and shape and all the eight triangles are also same in size and shade therefore the remaining parts of both the frames are also same this calculate the area of remaining parts of both the frames in the first frame the remaining part is as square of side sad therefore its area is said square in the second frame the remaining parts are also squares of side lengths exand wide therefore area of the remaining part is ix squared plus is square but the areas of remaining parts in both the frames have to be equal that means that square equals xquared plus why squared this expression is nothing but the pit agree herum this is one way to verify the therem this property can be alternately verified by ring squares on each side let see this also here we take aparticula gas that is a right angle triangle with side lengths three for and five ones the wide eight square in unit squares take the unit squares from bother legs and put them in bigger square made on hypotenus we find that the completely fill this bigger square what does it mean it means that the sum of areas of squares on legs is equal to the area of the square on the hypotenus so this is another way to verifypght angles herem although we have taken aparticlar case but this is true for any right angle triangle let talk about converse of dees if sum of squares of smaller sides is equal to the square of large side of ar triangle then cannot be said that the triangle is at right angle triangle has the triangle has to be a right angle triangle to verify this we take some examples take ar triangle with side lengths three units five units and six ions if this is right angle triangle then its hypotenus is six ones its square is third sags squares of three and five re nine and twenty five respective lay clearly thirty six is not equal to ninplestwenty five so this triangle should not be a right angle triangle use these squares to draw the triangle now using aprotractor we find that none of the angles is aright angle so this triangle is not a right angle triangle lets take another triangle with side lengths five six and seven ones if this is a right angle triangle then its hypotenus is seven ones its square is forty nine square of five and six are twenty five and thirty six respective lay clearly forty nine is not equal to twenty five plasthirty sags so this triangle should not be a right angle triangle use these squares to draw the triangle now using aprotractor we find that none of the angles is a right angle so this triangle is not a right angled triangle we can repeat this activity for many such triangles the result says that if the patagras property holds true for a triangle then the triangle must be a right angled triangle so what have you learnt you learnt that if a triangle is a right angled triangle then square of hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of legs of the triangle to get its better understanding we saw two activities you also learn the converse of this herem that if some of squares of smaller sides is equal to the square of the larger side of a triangle then the triangle has to be right angled triangle these outcomes are very useful in deciding the type of a triangle,"['right angle triangles ar right angle triangle', 'right angle triangle square', 'side lengths exand',

Concurrent Lines in a Triangle, consider any two lines ab and be these two lines will be either pangle or intersecting and therefore the lines are said to be pale or intersecting accordingly in the case of two intersecting lines the point where the lines intersect is called as the point of intersection but if three or more lines intersect at are common point the lines are set to be concurrent lines and the point at which they intersect is called the point of concurrency now we will learn concurrency of lines or line segments with respect to a triangle in a triangle the concurrent lines can be presented in the following ways they can pass through each vertex of the triangle to the mid pines of the opposite sides these concurrent lines are called medians of a triangle they can also pass from each vertex and meet the opposite sides at the right angle these concurrent lines are called altitudes of a triangle they can pass through each vertex of the triangle and bisecting the associated angle these concurrent lines are called angle by sectors of a triangle,"['lines', 'mid pines', 'line segments', 'common point', 'opposite', 'point']"

Organisation of Data, organisation of data usually data available to us is in an unorganized form called row data to draw meaningful influences we need to organise the data systematically for example agroup of students was asked for their favourite subject the results were as listed as shown here which is the least like subject and the one most like it is not easy to answer the question looking at the choice is written unsystematically we arrange the data in table using tally marks the number of talles before each subject gives the number of students who like that particular subject this is known as the frequency of that subject the number of times that poiticular entry occurs is called its frequency from the table frequency of students who like englishes for frequency of students who like mathematics says seven thus englishis least like subject and mathematics as most like the table mate is known as frequency distribution table as it gives the number of times and entry occurs in our daily life we come across many kinds of data which are potent tabular form like progress report temperature record sales report at cetera when we organise such data systematically in ar proper table it becomes easy to understand and interpret,"['proper table', 'record sales', 'tabular form', 'poiticular entry', 'example agroup', 'meaningful influences', 'data', 'table', 'subject', 'form', 'daily', 'entry']"
Some Applications of Linear Graphs, we know what to linear graft is ar graft that is the single straight line is known as aleniargraff there are very is real life situations where we can have linear grafts some of them are as follows criss as bind wet flower from ar grocery shaft the shopkeeper gives as slip of paper to cras describing the amount to be paid for different quantities of wheat flour here you can notice that as the quantity of wheat is increasing the cost is also increasing this is an example where one quantity effects another the amount to be paid depends on the quantity of wheat floor it means that the variable representing the quantity of wheat flour is an independent variable and the were will representing the amount to be pads are dependent variable since independent variable controls the value of the dependent variable so we call it as control variable to now can you find the cost of twenty two point five kilograms of wheat for an obvious method to ones of this question is unitary meters you can also find the one by joined graft describing the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable to draw the graph for the given data first choose as suitable scale on both the axis mark quantities of wheat flare along the exaxes and mark costs of the wheat flow along diviaxes for the codon at of the points to wheat plotted using the quantities as excordenats and costs as hi codon at as shown here now at all these points and join the points using or ruler since the graft obtain is ar line it is the linear graft you think this graph you can find the cost of twenty two point five kilograms of wheat floor for this loci twenty two point five on the ex axes and follow the wortica line through this point till it means the linear graft at point be now follow the horizontal line through be till it meets the axis this gives the cost of twenty two point five kilograms of heat flour as four fifty to peas in this example if one quantity increases the other quantity also increases so its an example of direct radiation no that in the examples of dalicwadiation to graft obtain is always of linear graft consider one more situation ar train can run at constant speed of seventy chalomiters for ar drawtind distance graft for this situation using this graft find the time taken by the train to travel three hundred fifty halomiters and also how much distance the train will cover in two and half hours first of all finds of values for distance and time to be plates since the train covers seventy calomiters in one or you can write it in ar table as shown similarly extend the table for the other values of time then on the codon at of the points to be plotted on the graph for suitable scale on the exaxes we take one in it as one or and on why axes we take one unit as fifty calomiters now mark time on the horizontal axis and distance on the vertical axis flat all the points on the cartation plain join all the points using or rule we get alaniargraf this is the time and distance graph for the train now corresponding to three hundred fifteen calomiters on the vertical axis we did the time to be for point five hours on the horizontal axis so the train wilt for and the half arsto cover three hundred fifty kilometes further cores pant into two and the half hours on the horizontal axis the distance covered is one seventy five calomiters on the vertical axis so the train would cover one seventy five calometers in two and half hours in addition to this relation between pons the pearls and their corresponding simple an twist can be represented by line graph the dithis data and its linear graft explore yourself how this graft came out from the given data for you have an tested properly whatever we have discussed so far here is the quark ap of our learning and the car per mole and be,"['more situation ar train', 'ar line', 'axis mark quantities', 'ar graft', 'wheat flour', 'distance graft', 'straight line', 'linear graft', 'half arsto', 'wheat', 'line', 'ar', 'quark ap', 'dithis data', 'kilometes further', 'train wilt', 'constant speed', 'direct radiation', 'suitable scale', 'unitary meters', 'obvious method', 'variable', 'graft', 'distance', 'mark', 'axis', 'other', 'wet', 'life', 'half', 'flour', 'quantities', 'linear', 'train', 'situation', 'data']"

Parallel Lines, we already know that when two lines are in ar plane either they are intersecting are coincident or parallel so par the lines are those lines that lie on the same plane and the not intersect each other how far they are extended we can observe pale lines in our deetuday live like in railway tracks ruraftes they are case etcetera even in farming ecan observe vegetable plants are planted in pale lines in the geometrical world to pan the lines can be seen extensive lay for example in rectangles squares pale low grams etcetera now we study different angles that are formed when another lancats two given pale lines the line that cuts two given lines is called are transverse to and this stand the relation between that angles properly let us perform an activated for this activity the three straws out of which two have the same pale two pens and two protractles with the hole at the senter of the zero lines take three straws and two protracters and joined them as shown her with the help of pens here red straw at like the lines which may be pale are non parallel and blue straw at like are transfers move the red straws such that they both are parallel move the protractors at that they both are on the same side of the transverse label the red straws as and mm and blue straw ate label the angles so formed from one to now measure the corresponding angles that are angle two and angle say you can observe that both angles have equal mass similarly the angles in each pair of corresponding angles are equal if the lines are pale now move the two straw such that they are non parallel in this case corresponding angles are not equal or we can say that if two pale lines are cut by are transversel the angles in each pair of corresponding angles are equal we use this result to obtain another resulyou can observe that lines an and the re in the secting lines so vertically opposite angles are equal that is angle to is equal to angle tray name this equation as equation van but angle two is equal to angle six as they are corresponding angles name this eqution as equsianto from aquasian one and two we get angle three is equal to angle says and you know that these are alternate interior angles similarly angle for is equal to angle five as they are also apair of alternate interior angles thus we can say that if two pale lines are cut by are transversel the angles in each pair of alternate interior angles are equal we now use the second result obtain another resul angle three and angle for form an linear pay so angle three plus angle for is equal to one eightydegrees name this equation as equation van and angle for is equal to angle five as they are alternate interior angles name this equation as equation to from equation one and two we get angle three plus angle five is equal to one ity degrees similarly we can obtain angle foul plus angle six is equal to one eightydegrees or we can say that when two pale lines are cut by are transversel then the angles in each pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversel are supplement re do you know corresponding angles can be found in shapes tue alternate angle skangbefound in set shades till now we have studied that if two lines are parallel then are transverse gives pairs of equal corresponding angles and equal alternate interior angles moreover interior angles on the same side of the transversel are supplement ray do you think converse of the above relations holds true that means if above relations hold true can we say that the given lines are parallel yes we can three these relations like axioms the first axiamez when are transverse cats two lines such that the angles in each pair of corresponding angles are equal then the lines have to be pale the second axiamez when are transverse cats two lines such that the angles in each pair of alternate interior angles re equal then the lines have to be pale draw an line al draw another line in which is perpendicular to all again draw another line m which is perpendicular to nm thus line m is perpendicular to ar line perpendicular to en so its obvious that m is pale tell because we draw al line m such that the sum of the interior angles on the same side of the transverse is one eight degrees to reinforce the understanding of the relationship between these angles let us discuss one example in the figure mpisparlel to car is pl to sin find the values of the angles ex why and said it is given that empispalel to cure we can observe that bc is transversel in disces therefo angle pure is equal to mc as they are alternate interior angles this implies ex is equal to seventy five degrees also pecuispall to as ar and ar is transversel angle pure plus angle as ar cu is equal to one eighty degrees as interior angles on the same side of the transversel are supplement ree this implies ex plus is equal to one eighty degrees this implies seventy five degrees plus why is equal to one eighty degrees this implies why is equal to one eighty degrees minor seventy five degrees which is equal to one hundred and five degrees also cure is parallel to sin and as ar is transverse therefore angle are as nm is equal to cu ar s as they are alternate interior angles this implies said is equal to one hundred and five degrees now we can conclude that when are transverselcats to pale lines if and only if the angles in each pair of corresponding angles are equal the angles in each pair of alternate interior angles are equl the angles in each pair of inter angles on the same side of the transversel are

Related Angles, let us now study related angles sometimes we can have two angles that are connected to each other here we are talking about complimentary and supplementary angles complementary angles are of bar of angles whose summers ninety degrees in all these sets of angles you be notice that the sum of angles is equal to ninety degrees so all these sets of angles are complementary angles if you look closely you will observe that the hands of clock and the picture frame are forming complementary angles on the other hand when the sum of the measures of two angles is one eightydegrees the angles are corn supplementary angles let us look at an exangle in all these sets of angles you can notice that two angles together form of straight line and the sum of angles is equal to one eighty degrees so all these sets of angles are supplementary angles notice that the lines drawn on telescope at right angles to right angles are equal to one eighty degrees therefore it is the good ex angle of supplementary angles now check out these two angles here point ohis the common vertices and side ostia is the common arm whereas oy and obe are the non common arms so we call angle one and the angle to as adjusant angles and are for bar of at tosite angles whose non common sides lie opposite to each other at an angle of one eightytdegrees is called the line up there next is vertically opposite angles vertically opposite angles are the angles that are opposite to each other the interesting thing is or ticle opposite angles are equal can you identify vertically opposite angles in the table fan it is very easy angles one to and angles three for are two bears of wortigally opposite angles so children angles are all around us we can classify them are coding to the sides and measure them in degrees,"['opposite angles', 'supplementary angles', 'angles', 'common', 'table fan', 'interesting thing', 'side ostia', 'straight line', 'other hand', 'picture frame', 'ex', 'opposite', 'line', 'other']"

Perpendicular From the Centre to the Chord, to can the picture of ababikugril if we note is the structure of the guil circles we find that its he circle consisting of numerous cords we already know that the line segment joining any two points of a circle is called e cord of that circle but what about this pin which passes through the centre of the gri let us discuss consider the figure show hi the circle with centre o as the cord ab if we draw straiclint from the point or to the cord ab at an angle of ninety degrees we due or pain al land segment oy perpendicular to the cord bi of the circle now let us perform an activity related to the perpendicular drawn from the centre of a circle to its cord to perform the activity first draw ar circle of any ribs say for centimetres using ar compass and mark the centre as o draw cot of the circle of any lim say six centimetres and name it as pic draw perpendicular to the cordpiku through the centero and mark its point of in the section we pecu as em now measure the tent pm an km what did you observe you might have observed that pm is equal to km in this case it is three centimetre is you can repeat the activity it be or the cords or for circles with some other radii you will always get the same result that is the perpendicular drawn from the centre of a circle to its cord by sex the cord now let us generalise the result of this activity with the cure the term states that ap perpendicular drawn from the centre of he circle to its cord by sex the cord now let us prove this term we have a circle with centre o and cord piece and om is perpendicular to the cordpikiu we need to prove that pm is equal to km we need to perform a construction to prove this tirem draw opi and oc in drangle om py and triangle om cu angle om py is equal to angle om cu as om is perpendicular to carp om is the common side between both the triangles opis equal to okiu as they are the radii of the same circle therefore triangle om py is congruent to triangle om cu by right and side congruence thus it prove that pm is equal to km as they are the corresponding parts of congruent triangles hence the term is pro let us work out an example now consider as circle of radius ten centimetres if the length of ar cord is sixteenth centimetres then find the distance of the cord from the sent let us draw the fic as per the given in formation here opis perpendicular to the cord iv now mark ob as ten centimetres and ab as sixteen centimetres we have seen that ar perpendicular drawn from the centre of he circle to its cord by sex the cord therefore ap is equal to pipe which is equal to centimetres it is given that obey is equal to ten centimetres in right angle triangle opibi is sin patagres term some of opisquared and pipe square is equal to obeys que be substituting the values of pipe and obey and solving for opi we get that op equals six centimetres hence let us tens of the cord from the centre of the circle is six centimetres now let us perform an more tivity first draw ar circle of any suitable radius using he compu and mark the centre as o draw cot of the circle of any lim and name it as pic mark the mid point of the cord pick as em and join it with the centero now measure the angles com py and om cu you will see that it of is angles is mantidigres this means that om is perpendicular to the cord piece if you repeat the activity for or the cords or for circles with some other radii we will get the same real we can generalise the result of the activity quit the next term the term states that the line segment joining the centre of the circle and the mid point of its cord is perpendicular to the cord it is given that picuris the cord of a circle with centuro and point em is the mid point of the cord pick this means pm is equal to km we must prove that om is perpendicular to the cord pic now join the sent o with the point sp an cu in triangle py om and triangle com op is equal to oc as they are the radii of the same circle om is the common site for both the triangles and it is given that pm is equal to km therefore triangle py om and triangle com are congruent by the sees congruent true thus it goes on to prove that angle om py is equal to angle om cu as they are the corresponding parts of congruent triangles they will this equation as equation an now angle om py la sangle om is equal to one ity degrees as these angles form al linear per using equation one and simplifying it further we get angle om cu is equal to ninetitigrees therefore angle om py is also equal to ninety degrees to entiquasion one therefore om is perpendicular to the cord pico hence we have proved the theorem let us now look at an example if the ribs of a circle is five centimetres and the distance of the court from its centre is four centimetres then find the length of the cord let us draw the figure as for the given informetion here obey is perpendicular to the cord ab therefore obey is equal to four centimetres now ab is equal timeti as the perpendicular drawn from the centre bisects the cord using pataguras terum in right angle triangle opib we get that the sum of obsquared and be be square is equal to obesquared substituting the values of obe and ob and solving further we get bb equals three centimetres so ab is twice of three centimetres that is six centimetres let us work out another example the diameter of the given circle is four centimetres and the distance of the court from the centre is one point six centimetres find the length of the cord it is given that ob is equal to one point six centimetres and ab is equal to four centimetres we know we bias is half of diameter so ao is equal to two centimetres also ob is perpendicular ties in right angle triangle eob using patagrist there we get obsquared plus ab squared is equal to eosquared on substituting the values of obe and eo and solving further we get ab equals one point two centimetres so the length of the

Special Triangles, we call what a triangles it is a particular type of polygon having only three sides and three angles what else do you already know about triangles well you learnt how to classify triangles there are two the trend was to classify triangles they can be classified on the basis of angles ang ongerbases of sides on the basis of angles triangles are classified as acute angle triangle right angled triangle and obtuse angled triangle and on the basis of sides triangles are classified as equilateral triangle isoucily triangle and killing triangle now you will learn about two special triangles that are equilateral triangle and isaucily triangle consider ar triangle shown here lets measure the length of et side of the triangle here you observe that the length of three sides of the triangle are equal this type of triangle is known as equilateral triangle hence ar triangle in which all the three sides are of equal length is called an equilateral triangle now lets measure the angles of the triangle what do you observe all three angles of the triangle measure sixty degrees hence for an equilateral triangle we conclude that all sides have same length and each angle has measure sixty degrees now take the ovtics of this equilateral triangle and move it up verticle what happened in this case two of the triangle sides got stretched by the same amount but the bottom side remained the same lets verify this by measuring the length of all the sides of the triangle here we observe two of the three sides are equal in length this type of triangle is known as isoucily triangle hence ar triangle in which two sides are of equal length is called an iceofcily triangle now lets measure all three angles of the triangle you can see the measures of two of the three angles are equal en this triangle piece and pear are called equal sides you are is the bees angle cu and angle are are called base angles and these are equale hence in an isoucily triangle two sides have same length and these angles opposite to the equal side are equal lets consider an example base on the properties of special triangles given a triangle picouare as shown in the figure side cu are is extended to pants and side put is extendeto point day the measure of angle scutes so formed is forty degrees what is the measure of angle pea in this figure angle or cup and angle py are equal as the angles opposed to equal sides of an isocilystrangle are equal now angle or cup is equal to angle study as the rvotically opposite angles this implies angle or cup is equal to forty degrees now using equation von angle py is equal to forty degrees,"['angle triangle', 'von angle', 'triangle sides', 'figure angle', 'angle cu', 'angle', 'figure side cu', 'equal side', 'triangle', 'angles triangles', 'base angles', 'angles ang', 'equal sides', 'sides triangles', 'side', 'equal lets', 'equal length', 'same lets', 'same length', 'particular type', 'angles', 'equal', 'point', 'triangles', 'same', 'sides', 'base', 'type', 'length', 'lets']"
Trigonometric Ratios, we already know how some right triangles can be imagined to be formed in de transit ratios in aritrangl we name it three sides apoingto how the ar plays with respect to its acutangels label this ritrangl as abc and azumdat angl ac be seta the side that tracis the acute angle theta is called the side opposite theta the side that is opposite to the right angle is called the hypotonis this is the long is side in array triangle the side that runs along side the angle theta and which is not the hypotenus is called the side adjacent to the angeltit what if we consider another acutangl of the triangle let us assume anglc ab as seta then sides bc ab and ac are opposite adjacent and hypotenuse respectively for the angeltita we all know what ratios are now we define certain ratios involving the sides of aritrangl with respect to its acute angles nonasstrigno metric ratios the trignometric ratios of the angles in arrange abc are defined as falls the ratio of the side opposite to angle upon hypotenus which is equal to ab upon ac is named as sin of angelc the ratio of the side adjacent to angles upon hypotenus which is equal to bc upon ac is named as cosine of anglc the ratio of the side opposite to angles upon the side adjacent to angelc which is equal to ab upon bc is named as tangent of angles the ratio of hypotenus and side opposite to angelc which is equal to ac upon ab is the reciprocal of sin of angle and is named as cos cent of angles the ratio of hypotenuse and side adjacent to angelc which is equal to ac upon bc is the reciprocal of cosine of angles and is named as secant of angle the ratio of the side adjacent to angle and the side opposite to anglc which is equal to by upon ab is the reciprocal of tangent of angelc and is named as cotangent of angle here the ratios the find are abbreviated as signs cosec tan sa cosec sec sa and cuts respective la also now that the ratios cosec sec sa and carts are respectively the reciprocals of sin cosec and tan sa the trignometric ratios sin cosec tan sa cosec sec sa and carts are also non as trignometric focions of anal now again looking at the expression ritiontofan tan we se danc is side opposite to angles that is ab upon side adjacent to angles that is bc which is same as ab upon ac upon bc upon as now the numerator is equal to sin and denominator is equal to cos hence tens is equal to signs upon cos similarly cuts is equal to cos upon sin how will you remember the expressions to can put rignometric ratios we can remember the word sakatoa to compute the sine cosine and tangent of an angle were so h so stands for sin is equal to opposite upon hypotenus sa h car stands for cosine is equal to adjacent upon hypotenus to to stands for tangent equals opposite upon agasen and the trignometric ratios cosec sec and cot can be found out by the reciprocal of the values of sin cause and tangespectiv la also no that sin acusdas and abbreviation for sin of the angle and sin ais not the prototof sin and in fact sin separated from aas no mena similarly this is true for other trignometric ratios now can you tell me how to the values of tricnometric ratios vary with the lens of the sides of the triangle if the angle remains the cm for this we consider aritrangla bc and taupoin ex on the hypotenus as or apointvay on ac extend now draw exempopendicula to ab and vi an perpendicular to ab extend can you find out how the trignometric ratios of angle an triangle am differ from those of angle a in triangles ab or from those of angle aintrangel way an to find it we first lukaddtrangls and triangles ex am and c ab similar since angle a is common in both triangles and both angles ex m a and c b a are ninety degrees so by a criterian triangles xa m and c ab are similar as we know corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional hence a m upon ab is equal to ex upon ac is equal to mix upon bc from this we have max upon x is equal to bc upon ac which is equal to sin similarly am upon x is equal to a b upon ac which is equal to cos and mix upon am is equal to bc upon a b which is equal to tan a and so on which shows that the values of trignometric ratios of angle a in triangle ex a m do not differ from those of angle a in triangles ab similarly we should check that the values of the trignometric ratios is same in triangle vi an also hence it is clear that the values of the trignometric ratios of an angle do not vary with to lens of the sides of the triangle if the angle remains the same also know that for the sake of convenience we may write sin square a cos square a in place of sin aholsquare cos awholesquare et cetera respective la but sec a is equal to cause ahole in vers not cos in versa we have discussed about six trignometric ratios of an acutangel if we know any one of the ratios can we find out the other ratios let sa if in aritrangl abc sin a is equal to one upon two which means bi upon ab is equal to one upon two or the lengths of the sides bc and ab are in the ratio one is to two so if bc is equal to a then ab will be to a where a is anequositive number now to find out other trignometric ratios we need to determine the length of the third side using patagrasterum ab square is equal to ac square plus bc square which implies ac squared is equal to three asquare therefore ac is equal to clasmina square root three a since a is positive and length of the side can be negative so ac is equal to sure route three a so all the other trignometric ratios can be written as shown,"['trignometric ratios sin cosec tan sa

Decimal Representation of rational numbers, the simple representation of or rational number written in the form of be upon cu can be found by using long division method however on dividing py by cu using the long division method either the remainder becomes zero all the remainder never becomes zero and we get he repeating string of remainders let discus both cases one by one case one when the remainder becomes zero on simplifying six upon twenty five using the long division method we find that the remainder is zero and the cushion is zero point two for so six upon twenty five equals zero point to for such ar decimal form of or rational number is called at terminating decimal form let us take up another example find the decimal expansion of negative one hundred thirteen upon two on simplifying one hundred thirteen upon two using the long division method we find that the remainder is zero and the cotiond is fifty six point five so negative one hundred thirteen upon two equals negative fifty six point five case two when the remainder never becomes zero on simplifying two upon nine using the long division method we find that the remainder never becomes zero and the number to repeat endlessly in the cushion so two upon nine equals zero point two two two two and so on such a decimal form of or rational number is called are non terminating recurring deimal form to simplify the notation we just write the number to one after the decimal and put or dot over it let us take up another example find the decimal expansion of negative fourteen upon ninety nine on simplifying fourteen upon ninety nine using the long division method we find that the remainder never becomes zero and the block of digits one and four epondrepeating endlessly in the cushion so negative fourteen upon ninety nine equals next it zero point to one four one for and so on in this case instead of putting dots over both one and four we put abor over both the digits to represent is repetition so we see that the decimal expansion of rational numbers can be either terminating one long terminating retain on the other hand can you conclude that any number having the terminating or are non terminating recurring decimal expansion is or rational number yes lets understand to some examples show that the given decimal number is he rational number the given decimal number can be rt in in the form of be upon cu are shown here and hence it is or rational number consider another example show that the given decimal number can be expressed in the form of be upon cu where be and he are integers and cu is not equal to zero let ex be the given decimal number so then ex is equal to five point five five five and so on which is equal to five plus zero point five five five and so on that is five plus ex therefore then ex is equal to five plus ex solving for ex we get nine ex is equal to five therefore ex is equal to five upon nine similarly for the simal numbers having two repeating digits after the decimal point you multify the number by one hundred and proceed as we did in the pre vis example consider one more example show that the given decimal number can be expressed in the form be upon co where and he are integers and he is not equal to zero let ex be the given decimal number note here that for does not repeat but the block of digits seven and five repeats here two digits are repeating so we multiply ex by hundred we get one hundred ex is equal to forty seven point five seven five seven and so on this can be retinas one hundred ex is equal to forty seven point one plus ex are shown here on subtracting you get ninety nine ex is equal to forty seven point one that is ninety nine ex is equal to four hundred seventy one upon ten ex is equal to four hundred seventy one upon nine hundred ninety lets have a quick re cup of our learning,"['terminating decimal form', 'ar decimal form', 'decimal number', 'decimal point', 'decimal form', 'rational number', 'decimal', 'long terminating', 'long division', 'quick re', 'rational numbers', 'more example', 'other hand', 'simple representation', 'number', 'terminating', 'numbers', 'point', 'form', 'example']"

Square Numbers, square numbers think about the word square it is at tip of geometrical shape which you are already aware of what is the property of this shape all sides of ar square are equal linen and its all unbers are equal to ninety degrees square numbers are mulsimilar to the area of square the area of ar square is sine multiplied by side quaresined means the length of side consider the following squares and their ages here one four nine and sixteen are called square numbers but twenty point to five and thirty point to five are not the square number observe carefully as square number is obtained by multiplying and natural number by itself in these two cases twentiploine two five and thirty point two five are obtained by multiplying decimuls by itself not an natural number therefor they are not asquare number so in general asquare number as is always obtained by multiplying an natural number en by itself or is is equal to en squared quere en is an natural number since in is an natural number therefo is also an natural number so ar square number is also ar natural number remember it is also called perfect square let see are all square numbers up to one hand re twenty five thirty six forty nine sixty four eighty ne one hundred twenty five is obtained by multiplying fyve by itself thirty six is obtained by multiplying six by itself forty nine is obtained by multiplying seven by itself sixty four is obtained by multiplying eight by itself eighty one is obtained by multiplying nying by itself one hundred is obtained by multiplying ten by itself it is advisable to remember all these numbers these are the only square numbers up to one hundred so if you are asked that seventy eight is asquare number or not then you can non so its you remember days let see it in another what seventy eight lies between sixty four and eighty one sixty four and eighty one are the squares obtaint and nine respect if seventy eight is as square number it must be the square of ar natural number between eight and nine but there is no natural number between eight and nine so seventy eight is not ar square number any natural number can have these ten digits as their unit digit so if we find the squares of these digits then we can flying the unit digits of every square number if an natural number has zero as its unit digit then its square also has zero as its unit digit if an natural number has one as its unit digit then its square also has one as its unit died if an natural number has two as its unit digit then its square has four as its unit digit if an natural number has three as its unit digit then its square has nine as its unit eged if anatural number has four as its unit digit then its square has six as its unit died if an natural number has five as its unit digit then its square also has five as its unit digit if anatural number has six as its unit digit then its square also has six as its unit digit if natural number has seven as its unit digit then its square has nine as its unit digit if an natural number has eight as its unit digit then its square has four as its unit de ge if an natural number has nine as its unit digit then its square has one as its unit digit do these square numbers have all these ten digits as their unit digits no they have only zero one four five six or nine at units plays no these square numbers do not have two three seven or eight at units qulays we can generalise that all the square numbers end with zero one four five six or nine at units plays can we say that if are number end in zero one four five six or nine then it must be asquare number no for ex numbes fifteen it ends with five as unit plays fifteen lies between nine and sixteen nine and sixteen are the squares of three and four respective lay if fifteen is a square number it must be the square of a natural number between three and four but there is no natural number between three and four so fifteen is not a square number even though it has five as its unit digit so you can just say that if an number has two three seven or eight as unit digit then the number is not a square number observe that square of a number ending with one or nine at units place has one at units place of its square number observe that square of a number ending with four or six at units place has six at units place of its square number observe that square of a number ending with three or seven at units place has nine at units place of its square number lets observe the square of a number ending with zero at units square if a number contains one zero at the end then there are two zeros at the end of its square if ar number contains two zeros at the end then there are four zeros at the end of its square so it can be said that square numbers can only have even number of zeros at the end so if a number has ought number of zeros at the end then the number can not be asquare number so here you saw how a geometrical shape that is square help do you to understand the concept of square numbers which are also called perfect squares it is advisable to memorise all the square numbers up to one nandrad any square number has only zero one four five six and nine as their unit diges you also learn some techniques to check if a number is a square number or nor,"['square number', 'units square', 'square', 'asquare number', 'number', 'ex numbes', 'hand

Square Root of a Number, get or wants to know how much distance he will cover if he writes from the point to the point to be of this of hall the to distances are given using the pthagorest herem we get be square is equal to asysquared plus we see squared by putting the values and simplifying them we get be square is equal to fifty three so he needs to find that number whose square is fifty three there are many other situations also where we ni to find an number whose square is known let see some more if you know the area of a square can you find it sites for example if the are of a square field is five hundred and seventy six meters square then we can write site square is equal to five hundred and seventy sex in order to find the side we need to find at value which when multiplied by itself gives five hundred and seventy sex or we need to find or number whose square is five hundred and seventy sex consider another situation which is also related to as square for this square can you find out the lend of its dignel lets find at bothedagnals of ar square are the same so we can calculate either of them lets find pear consider the fringe phe are it is are right angle train gill using the pythagorest herem we can ride that we are square is equal to cure squared plus cup squared by putting the values and solving further we get we are squared is equal to two point eight at its dignalpear is that number whose square is two point eight at in all these situations we need to find the number whose square is known finding the number with the known square is known as finding the square root or we can say that it is the in also peration of square ring do you now other invers operations inverse operation of addition is subtraction and the inverse operation of multiplication is division get back to square root if you multiply one point one by itself you get one point to one so we say one point to one is the square of one point one and one point one is the square root of one point to one let take sum numbers and see their square roots one is the square of ne therefore the square root of one is one for is the square of two therefore square root of for is two nine is the square of three therefore square root of nine is three sixteen is the square of four therefore square root of sixteen is for so squaring is aprocess of multiplind and number by it sell and its inverse process is known as finding square root obso multiplind three by three gis nine multiplying negative three by negative three also gives nine so what should be the square root of nine negative three or positive three both are the square roots of nine so square roots of nine are three and negative three observe this stable negative one point one is also a square root of one point to one similarly negative one is also asquare root of one negative to is also asquare root of for negativefor is also a square root of sixteen positive square root of or number is denoted by the symbol so the value of this sexuession is three not negative three similarly the value of this expression is to not negative to so every number has two square roots and positive square root is represented by the symbol so you have learnt what asqure root is it is inverse of squaring an number finding the number with the known square is known as finding the square root you also learned that this symbol represents positive square root,"['square root obso', 'square root', 'square roots', 'square', 'right angle train gill', 'other invers', 'inverse process', 'inverse operation', 'stable negative', 'sum numbers', 'fringe phe', 'dignel lets', 'much distance', 'other', 'root', 'inverse', 'negative', 'lets']"
Finding the Square of a Number, cake of wants to know the area of his bed room floor so that he can perches ar carpet of equal area of for the floor the floor is in the shape of ar square with side ten feet can you help him in finding out the area of the floor or lets find it out we know that area of ar square is equal to the square of it side so the area of the bed room floor is ten square square feet o it is equal to ten multiplied by tend square feet which is equal to one hundred squared feet so it was ease we just multiplied ten by it sell to find out the square of ten isn tet similarly there are many situations war we need to find out the squares of numbers you can easily find out the squares of numbers like three four five at cetera square of or number means to multiplied that number by it sellssquare are small numbers like ume two three four up to ten are easy to find out but can we find out the square of forty six so easily to find out the square of forty six multiply forty six by forty six by usual multiply cation is there any easier method to find out the square of forty six yes right forty six as forty lasts then we get forty phe six multiplied bive forty places on multiplind and simple fine further we get two thousand one hundred sixteen but this is also time taken so lets introduce us to one motrix of finding the square of numbers for this you have to remember the squares of numbers up to twenty five this method is used to find out the square of numbers between twenty five and seventy five lets find out the square of forty four there are two states in the first step subtract twenty five from the given number subtract twenty five from forty four we get nineteenth these are the first two dees in the second step take the difference of fifty and that number and square the resulted number now take the difference between forty four and fifty and square that number in the btract fifty from forty four or forty four from fifty it does nt make any gene because we will square that number so both numbers will no sin consider thirty six as the last two digits of the square so one thousand nine hundred thirty six is the square of forty four now calculate the square of fifty eight subtract twenty five from fifty it we get thirty trait these are the first two degets now subtract fifty from fifty eight and square at we get sixty four these are the last two digits so square of fifty eight is we thousand try hundred sixty four we just learned how quickly we can find out the square of our number using this trait lets take another tip of fi number find out the square of thirty sits subtract twenty five from thirty sets we get eleven now subtract thirty six from fifty we get fourteen on squaring we get one hundred ninety sets in the situation nine and six out the last two deges and one is the carriover to the first two diets so at remaining ondred the eleven they are for the square of thirty six is one thousand to hundred ninety sets now lets find out the square of numbers between seventy five and one hundred twenty five find out the square of one hundred four in first step subtract one hundred from the given number and add the differed to that number take the difference of one hundred and one hundred four which is four and added to one hundred four on adding we get one hundred eight these are the first three digits of the square in the second step take the square of the defend square of four sixteen which forms the last two de gets so the square of one hundred four is ten thousand eight hundred sixteen again find out the square of one hundred twenty take the difference of one hundred and one hundred twenty which is twenty and added to one hundred twenty on adding we get one hundred forty these are the first three diets now take the square of the difference which is four hundred zero see or the last two digits and at remaining for to the first three digits one hundred forty plus four is equal to one hundred forty four they are for square of one hundred twenty as fourteen thousand for hundred now do you think that we are done with the methods now there is one more method to find out the square of numbers ending with five consider following patan what do you observe here here we observe that if we take are two digit number ending with five then to find out its square multiplied the first digit of given number with its succeeding de get and write twenty five after red similarly if we take ar three digit number ending with five multiplied the first two digits of the given number with its succeeding de get and write twenty five after rad to understand this method in detail let take up any number find out the square of eighty five multiply eight with its succeeding digit which is nine we get seventy two now write square of five after it which is twenty five so the an series seven thousand to hundred twenty five square numbers are widely used in different branches of mathematics and science in geometry while using pathagrastherum we use square numbers consider following triangle according to pathagrastherum square of hypotenus is equal to the sum of the square of popendeuila and bats here three squares plus four squared is equal to five squared again observe one more triangle here six squared plus eight square is equal to ten squared the triplet of numbers where square of one number is equal to the sum of the square of other to numbers is sqalled apatagorin tripled here three four five and six eight ten are pythagorean triplets in general for any natural number em which is greater than one we have square of two em plus whole square of em squared minus one is equal to hold square of em squared plus one so two m msquared plus one and msquared minus one form apartagurian tripled can you find out summotripleds yes we can find out sum or pythagorean triplets using this relation find out apitagorian triplet whose smallest number is at let us quirststake msquared minus one as eight so msquared is equal to nine and m is equal to trait therefore two m is equal to six and msquared plus one is equal to pen the triplet is thus six eight and ten but eight is not the ones number in this tripled so let us take two m is equal to at that is m is equal to four so msquared minus one is equal to fifteen and msquared plus ne is equal to seventeen the triplet is thus eight fifteen and seventeenth with eight as the smallest number similarly we can find out other pythagorean triplets,"['square square', 'square numbers', 'ar square', 'digit number', 'number subtract',

"Plastics : Characteristics, Structure, Uses", to day if we think of storing food making electric applinses packaging goods constructing homes are manufacturing safety gars plastic seems to be most convenient pot makes plastic source tile how did plastics become the material of choice for so many wearied applications it is all because of the characteristic properties of plastics metals like iron getrastat when left exposed to air and water this is because metals are chemically reactive however plastics are chemically unreactive they do not react with air and water and are therefore resistant to corrosion this makes plastic as suitable materials for storing food items and several other chemicals plastics we less than metals for comparable dimensions they have good strength and are long latin it is because of light wait good strength and urability of plastics that they are used in cars and air crafts plastics are poor and at turs of heat and electricity the handles of cooking vessels are made up of plastic to keep the heat away from reaching our hands the handles of true drivers used by electricions and the electric wires have plastic covering that acts as an electrical insulator and protects electric current from passing through them similarly electrical switches plots and sockets also have plastic covers plastics can be easily moulded and therefore are used to make large variety of objects of different shapes and sizes the packets used in our home were earlier made from iron metal sheets but nowadays they are mostly made up of plastics it is because plastics are generally cheaper than metals and can be made easily like synthetic fibers plastics are also polymers the to polymer is used to describe macromolecule made up of several identical monomers or repeating units the properties of these polymers depend on of variety of factors like the monomer unit the linkages between each monomer and the intermolecular and the intromolycular forces that exists between the polymers in plastics the monomers may be arranged in two ways the plastics in which monomers are arranged leaniarly and have no cross links are called carmoplastakes on the other hand the plastics in which long polymer chains are cross line with one another are cold as parmosetting plastics the dm plastic is thus abroad term and compasing of wide range of polymers made of monomers derived from the prodasobtained but the fractional distillation of prudoil polythene also non as polyethylene is au polymer of eighteen monomers several it then molecuse joined together to form polythene poly propene or poly propailine is apolimer of propene monomers polyvinyl chloride or peel see is the polymer of chloro ethene can you predict the name of the monomer of poly tetra chloro ethylene also non as teflon the answer is tetra of floroithiline the properties of plastics make them the re choice for the production of variety of things that is now about uses of some common types of plastics polythene is use widely in making polybags and as the packaging materials for food items polyethylene tereftalate also non as be eat pets is used for making containers that can be used in microwave ovens and bottles for packing mineral water polyvinyl chloride is extensively used for making plumbing pits concealing electrical lining flowing up ol street and furniture the flown is or special plastic on what oil and water denotstic it is used for nonsticcoting on cocars pellimine is another plastic that can tolerate heat better than any other plastics it is used for making an break able kitchen were than fire resistant fabrics the uniforms of fire men have ac coating of mellamine plastic to make them fire resistant back elite is he hard and tough plastic it is used for making hands of cooking utensils it is also used for making electrical switches plus and sockets et cetera plastics also find extensive use in the health care industry they are used in making bottles sachets and strips to store medicines they are also used in making syringes gloves and threads used for stitching wounds thus we can say that plastics have become an incredibly important part of our

Migration of Animals, animals travel immense distances across continents insert one amino or nourishment or for reduction their ability to locate their way on these incredible journeys has puzzled us for long this fascinating phenomena of animals travelling from one habitat to another at certain fixed times of the year is known as migration for example the siberin crane migrates to india from rest on siberia travelling at distance of six thousand for hundred and fifty kilometers similarly the articturn migrate between the arti and the unchartic circles travelling at distance of merely thertyfy thousand kilometers twice year migration is one of the greatest wonders of nature have you ever thought why animals undertake such mass movements there are many reasons animals migrates to escape from harsh weather in search of food and to roots their breeding ground the monarch butterflies migrates from the has winters of canada to the lone climate of mexico travelling thousands of kilometres amazing fact is that the mono butterfly has never visited these foreign places earlier but they still make their trips successfully butterflies sleep on winter only one spring day they stress in metres wider bees in the african of one migrate between genes masimara and the zones celingity national part bonds consisting of millions of wilderbeast migrate across planes crossing crocodile infestant waters inverses of fresh pastures the land has been dry here in tanzania for four months in search of green pastures more than ar million wilderbeas set of one plastic journey on route they are forced to cross the crocodile infested mararive if they do not cross they will star but if they do they risk their lies they asserts the danger and make on the search of the stambead carries most of them across the crocodiles make sure some wilderbeast stay behind for those who make it to the other side the last land of the seringetty or wait them and would support them for the next six months october ends with the comes of green pastures in astralias cristmas island adult red crabs suddenly begin the magnificant migration from the forest to the cost to breed and release eggs this happens every year in early november on cristmas island in indian ocean the moon traces the emergence of the red crab in november the ms migration begins which will involve ity million of them the males march first their migratory as take no account of the road traffic the crab travels for two weeks to weeks their destination the share when the female arrive they made each female crab produces thousands of eggs after two weeks the mothers march toward sea carrying their offspring when the mothers reach the sea they release the eggs these will be the next generation to join crismas islands red army on another november mats the siberiangrain and the articturn migrate because both artic and siberia become extremely cold during winters see turtles migrate across the aclanticocion and the sea between boraging and nesting grand and also seasonally to warmer waters often these migrations take them hundreds and even thousands of miles researches recently track and are all female see total covering he distons of more than ni dee thousand clometers using scientific technology from in donate to you as say one of the longest to recorded migration of any vertebrate animal in rivers ease travel from the fresh waters of the river to the saline sea waters to lay their legs samonfish they migrate from the cold river water where the on to the warm water of oceans where they feed they must again migrate back to the waters where they were born swimming against the flow of water for the entire journey and this includes travelling up water forts once they lay their eggs they die this kind of migration is known as breeding migration locus are harmful migratory insects when their swarms become too large they take off in flies during their journey this settle on standing cracks and destroy all vegetation which comes in their part in contrast some animals migrate when dangerous conditions arise in the habitat for example rain die mosquitoes reach play proportions in ages the females sub the blood of the rain dia to nourish their eggs each rain die loses up to two pens of blood to mosquitoes every week when the biting becomes on bearable they run sometimes they travel body miles per day to escape the persistent blood suckers their vast convogations stretch as far as their eye gain see the herd even crosses water to escape from the mascuetos they are surprisingly good we as you must be wondering how do these animals the side way to go and which direction to set of sciences use the vis methods in their studies on migration trying to solve the midstream behind the phenomena of migration they use tiny trans meters tagging rains hidden cameras and animal bag marks to trap the pattern in the movement of animals scientists have discovered that the migrating animals choose their direction as well as destination migisual and non visual clots visual close mlstlyplay of vital row migratory animals take help of familiar geographical land marks stars and sons rays some of these animals also follow patterns of polarised light in the sky for example rain deer find their we with help of the sun similarly the birds follow the cost line while in non visual clues include smells taste and sounds agratic animals follow bats of water quality waves and ocean currents most remarkable of all is their ability to sense the earth magnetic field and use it during migrations scientists have discovered that the migratory animals evolve themselves for migration to reserve that as feel the migratory animals feed intensively before setting off to protect themselves the migratory animals mostly travel in groups to save energy the migratory animals often hit on to ocean currents take the left from favourable winds or rating hot air are ends called canals when the migratory animals needs to rest and review this select and stop at he safe place in their roots let summarises the phenomena of animals travelling from one habitat to another at certain times of the year is known as miration animals migrates to escape from ash weather in search for foods to reach their breeding ground to used by scientists to track animals tiny transmitters tagging rains hidden cameras animals

Climatic Adaptations in Animals of Tropical Rainforests, have you ever waste documentry on the amazon forests if yes what did you notice while you must have observed ar lot of trees green ry and wild animals did you know that one tenth of all the species of living organazems on earth are found in the amazon forests of precise yes it is ar home for number of species some of the dead list animals and plants are found here even the anacondes huge snakes are found in these mysterious forests of amazond have you ever wondered what makes the forests of amazon to have such huge diversity of living arganazons these sickle these forests are tropical rain forests and the ites their climatic conditions that make them ar home for huge bile diversities now lets get to know about tropical rain forests and their climatic conditions do you have any idea why tropical rain forests are named so tropical rain forests are named so because they are found mostly in tropical regions and reset huge amounts of rainfall now you must be thinking what ar tropical region is for the is that look at our earth tropical region refers to the region which stretches from the tropic of cancer at twenty three point five degrees north latitude do the tropic of caprecon at twenty three point five degrees south latitude what kind of climate as the tropical region have tropical region hasof won climate because the equator is centered within this one in tropical rain forests the temperature as with then degree celsius in winters and it can rise up to forty degree celsius in summers let we tell you an interesting fact about the tropical region this region receives and equal length of the days and the night do you know why the sically the tropical region lies near the equator due to which it is not till that in relation to the sons location so the amount of an light receive throughout the year is the same these regions also show rainfall all the are round with little to know dry season what inferences can you draw by studying the climate of the tropical region yes we can conclude that this region has are hot and human climate which is perfect for thesis tons of ar wide variety of plants and animals the tropical rain forests are an important part of the tropic region these forest are mainly found in the western cards and as and in in dia south station central america and central africa these forests harbour are variety of plant and animal species the mega its of animals found in these forests are monkeys as gorillas tigers events leperets words insects at cetera due to the presence of large number of animals and intense competition for food spaces and shelter is observed in tropical rain forests you must be wondering that if there is such an intense competition then how different animals survive here the uncerays adaptations that study some of the adaptations observed in the animals of tropical rain forests if we have less pace how can we make are house pass and well accommodated what about making floors yes that can surely help us forests also show the presence of different flowers like the crown the under fore and the ground in order to avoid competition for space on ground some animals of tropical rain forests have adapted al lion trees the most common example of such an animal is monkey they have developed several adaptations to survive in this habitat monkeys have long tails which help them in holding branches what jumping from one branch of tree to another apart from monkeys red eyed frogs are also found here they have sticky pads on their feet which help them to cline trees do you know to are white competition for food some animals have adapted themselves to get food which is not easily accessib one such animal is the keel build token tropical rain forests are home for keel build token birds this bird shows are variety of adaptations to survive in the tropics this explore the adaptations found in token birds the keel build token has developed of very long be the sides of the beak takes up about one third of its own body it is supported by hollow bones and is made up of geritin which is of fibres protein this be helps the birds and picking rasping breaking and consuming almost every tropical food in the rain forest it also helps and reaching the fruit lying on the brand which is too we to support the weight of the bird another adaptation in token is that they have four toes and each foot to facing forward and two facing backward this helps them to have are better grapon branches and resting forts when you look at at token you will see beautiful brightly coloured feathers these brightly coloured feathers are also an adaptation for their survival in the tropical rain forest do you know how well these feathers help them in blending with the surroundings which hide them from predators is there any specific term for this feature yes this feature is called come flat come of large is also seen in big cats like lines and tigers they come of large with their surroundings and attack their prey they also have adaptations like sensitive hearing and short by sight tropical rain forests are also found in some regions of in dia do you know that the tropical rain forest of where tin parts of in the are home to some of the most wonderful creatures one of them is the wisually interesting line tails ma cake its most striking feature is the large silver main that frames its fats is there any significance of this main during grin the main keeps the rain drops under the macankys fats which allows it to keep searching for food easily the line tails of accokee feeds on fruit seeds young leaves stem flowers but insects worms etcetera another well known animal of the indian tropical rain forest is the elephant it has acquired many structural adaptations to helped survive and its natural habitat we all sweat it out when it is hot outside but do you know that an elephant toes not have sweat glands then how does to keep its body cool in the hot and human climate of ar tropical rain forest well it has other ways of keeping itself cool its large years not only help in hearing very soft sounds clearly but also actors are fan to keep its body cool there is also apart of an elephant that no other animal has do you know which far that is yes it is its trunk no other animal has at trunk is there any significance of its trunk since the make of an elephant to too short to allow the mouth to reach the ground they have develop or structure called are trunk which serves many important functions the elephant uses this extremely muscular structure for smelling touching and transferring food and water from the ground to the mouth it is all the use for spraying water on the body can you list some other adaptations of an elephant an elephant also has modified deep in the form of tusks which task held the elephant to tear down the bark of trees this spite being such huge biodiversity areas to day tropical rain forests are disappear ring from the face of the globe duto human activities like deforestation global warming etcetera we all must look for any chapters to save or tropical rain forests and biodiversity with an them we study that tropical rain forests hav hot and humid climate due to high rainfall and he temperature ranging from fifteen degree celsius to forty degree celsius tropical rain forests harbours ovive variety of living organisins including herbs shrubs trees and animals different animals show different adaptations to survive in tropical rain forests for example monkeys have long tails to grasp branches red eyed frogs have sticky pads on their feet which help them to climb trees gel built token has a long beak which helps the bird in picking grasping breaking and consuming fruits in the rain forest the line tail mechachi has a silver mean which keeps the raindrops out of the macarchi's face which allows it to keep searching for food easily no matter if it is raining,"['celsius

Migratory birds, all birds have not adapted to survive comfortably in extreme conditions of winters thus they migrate to warmer regions in winter and come back when winter is over when the river of the siberia are frozen in winters the siberian cranes with the proper century in india in in dia located in rates can the paratpers bird century is one of the fine centuries of the walls where many birds spent their winters comfortably,"['bird century', 'warmer regions', 'extreme conditions', 'century', 'birds']"
Climatic Adaptations in Animals of Polar Regions, while looking at apolar bear and ar brown bear can use for the differences apart from the colour you can also notice that this skin of able bear is thicker as com bear to ar brown bear do you know why now we can this picture of atribal man and are modern man can you spot any different tribalman is wearing all indigenous clots while modern man is wearing regular short and bands what could be the reason you must have thought why fishes can swim birds can fly and humans can walk basically we adapt to the conditions of where we live ar polar bear as the excanfor protection from cold are modern man wears contemporary clots to fit into society fishes can when birds can fly and humans can walk which as they are adapted to live in water sky and ground respectively living organisns are affected by the climatic conditions of their habitat and surroundings for example different animals develop specific features to protect themselves from extreme conditions of the invament they inhabit which may be cold out or wet such specific features that allow an organism to survive in apertical and invament are called adaptations organisinliving in polar regions and tropical rain forests show are variety of adaptations let see the adaptations observed in animals of polar regions first of all body understand about polar regions the regions of old surrounding it geographical folds are known as the polar regions there are two polar regions in the world the art thick at the north fold and in tatica at the south pole the polar regions are the cold is places on the earth as most of the areas are covered wave snow sometimes the temprature can tip to mines cite seven degrees cells is do you know the and night may last for six months at folds during one year here the sun rises for thick months and that for another six months you must we wondering is lie even possible in these matures faces yes even in these extreme climatic conditions might grow organisons plants and animals are able to endure do you know how it is possible it is mainly because they bear some specific adaptations to survive in these extreme cold conditions can you name some animals residing in the polar regions animals ly polar bears penguins many type of fishes mask axon renders boxes seeiles wals and birds at cetera are fountain polar regions now we will understand the adaptations in polar animals which help them to survive in this inhospitable climate the two common animals inhabiting polar regions are hole bear and penguin let us understand how polar bears and penguins are adapted to the climatic conditions of polar regions you must have seen your mother separating small black pebbles from black lentils well it becomes very difficul because these two blend with each other similarly polar bears have white collar for which help them to blend with the white by ground of the snow as the result they are not easily visible by their prey do you know polar bears are so amazing that they can detect the smell of another animal as far away as twenty miles this characteristic helps them to locate and catch the prey this aids them in the search of food during winters when we feel cold we lear ourselves ways different clothes or blankets while etcetera polar bears definitely do not have ar planted but they do have their for for makes the body of apolar bear insulated two extreme cold they also have extraprotection again cold because of the presens of athicklare of fat under the skin which provides insulation thus solar bears can maintain their normal body them peritur even if the outside and precurous subsero we know that snow is good for scheme but not for walking however the long journey of polar bears on eyes has made easier which their wide and large bars present at the bottom of their feet they act like tiny suction caps that help in walking on snow though polar regions are extremely cold there are some warm days also during worm days polar bears need to keep themselves cool thus hey swim which help them to keep themselves cool their bars help them in swimming they can even remain under water for a long time by closing their nostrils polar bears tiffically walk at ar relaxing pays in order to avoid over heating another familiar animal found in the polar region is the penguin benguins have physical and behaveril adaptations for extreme cold they live on land and are very good swimmers let us understand how benins are adapted to the climatic conditions of polar regions the white colour of benguins help them and blending with the snow just like polar bears benguins possess thick skin and have a lot of fat under their skin for insulation have you ever notice that benguins always stain groups can you think of for reason well let me tell you that this is there strategy to hurdle together and keep themselves warm benguins are birds still they cannot fly in the air however they can swim in freezing water and can stand extra hours on their raised feet benguins have special adaptations which allow them to swim under water for a long time these include streamlined body and webbed feet which are held full and swimming since they have no use of wings their wings are modified into flippers which help them in gliding through the water with speed and eats do you know benguins can swim fifteem miles per or that fast isn't it do you go to hill stations when it is hot in ea city probably yes similarly animals also move all migrato wide warmer or collar environments generally many birds of arctic regions move to the warmer regions before the arrival of extreme cold weather can you give an example one of the examples is with siberian crane at the onset of chilling winters in siberia siberian grains migrate towards the warmer regions of india like barrebur and rates can and sulphate and hareana for protection from cold conditions after the winter is over they come back to their net ive location just like we come back to our home after along vacations so we have seen that animals adabthemselves according to the conditions of their environment polar regions are snow covered extremely cold with six months of day and six months of night polar bears have adapted to polar regions and thus possess thick for tears of fat white coler large in white balls swimming abilities at cetera to combat cold benguins have stem lined bodies wings modify as flippers strategic huddling together as some of the adaptations to survive in cold conditions onditi,"['polar regions animals', 'polar bears benguins',

Adaptations, we will now closely examine adaptations of polar bears that live in extremely cold and widens of the polar regions the have long co and sharp clones which help them to water lines they are broad pave let cos and cos that are partially we to make the animal and excellent swimmer polar bears have white for to to which their prey is unable to see them the take purpose protects them from extreme cold they are of fat under the skin helps them to insulate their body against call polar bears not enter deep amination most pole gas remain active through of the year the have the with the to to are just their metabolic rate when the foot care only pregnant females enter the dent to give birth to young ones the young ones life with their mothers are about twenty eight months to learn the survival skills the animal is also in dowwhith the phenomenal sense of smell capable of smelling apart as twenty mons of way or six feet beneath the smell now whether see the adapted features of monkeys they possess many adapted features that help them with every day line their hands which opposable fans allow them to climb trees easily and rape food the colour of their for helps them to camouflage against the branches of the trees on important adaptation is its long till which acts as the fifth well and allows them to hang ar great distance down from the branches where it lives the bird to can possesses of long and large beet which helps it to reach the fruits and branches which are other wise two week to supported way the ball is long in light the two can ill is made of the same material that are meals of meter pons that is carritan the bird has four toes on each foot of which to go forward and two go backward this helps it to cling on to the tree branches and any other perching spots elephant the gentle giant is an dot which he tap tide eaturseuire to live successfully in the rain forest the trunk is form of the nose and upper lip tens it has as strong sense of smell the trunk is also used for picking up food tet is striped with two fingers which let the elephant examine and even pick up small objects the large years of the elephant elite here even if very soft sun and also help to keep the body come in the hot and human climate of the rain forest the years can also be used as fans to keep out are away from the elephant the tusks of the elephant are actually the elephant in size of teeth the legs of the animal or colon light having same wet from top to bottom their feet are round and have pattomove silent ly to the on the growth of the forest,"['amination most pole', 'swimmer polar', 'polar', 'other wise', 'great distance', 'fifth well', 'important adaptation', 'opposable fans', 'day line', 'smell capable', 'pregnant females', 'metabolic rate', 'extreme cold', 'take purpose', 'water lines', 'sharp clones', 'long co', 'lip', 'same', 'large', 'sense', 'ones', 'pave', 'fans', 'other', 'meter', 'light', 'long', 'branches', 'food', 'smell', 'cold']"
Light, to day we will learn about an energy that is all around us and heads us to see the world that is light children can you see the things kept in this dark room probably not her now it is visible now we can see the things in this room it is all begus of the presence of light but what is light light is the kind of energy which is detected by human eght and as produced by deferens sources the sun stars fire lamp candle and lightning are the weariest sources of light can you tell or we are able to see the things around us well as soon as the light from the source falls on the object it bounces off from its surface and enters our eyes this is how we see things this is called reflection of light law of reflection states that when the ray of light strikes the plane surface it returns in the same medium with change in angle and you see example of reflection is when we look in a mirror we see an image of ourselves reflected that have you ever seen reflections in water actually the surface of water also acts like mirror and change the direction of light that falls on it so we see theflections in water we can see many examples of reflections in our everyday light remember any shiny or polished surface can act like mirror and change the direction of light that falls on it,"['light light', 'fire lamp candle', 'deferens sources', 'many examples', 'same medium', 'human eght', 'dark room', 'light', 'surface', 'sources', 'room']"
Dispersion of Light, let us now study about the spersion which is the phenomenon of splitting of white light into its component colours on passing through ar prism place the prism on horizontal surface and the source of white light on its left place the card board with small hole to tan the source of white light and the prism this arrangement produces an narrow beam of white light on the other sight of the prism place screen to obtain the emergent rays on it we obtain of coloured battin on the screen in the order represented by the ecronem with cure the band of seven colours known as the spectrum of white light is formed biges the different colours present in white light interact it at different angles,"['different colours', 'prism place', 'small hole', 'card board', 'horizontal surface', 'white light', 'place', 'colours', 'different', 'prism']"
Light and its Propagation, what is light in the dark room we are unable to see anything but in ar bright room we are able to see everything around us light is the form of energy which makes things visible do you know we are do we get light from during the day time the sun acts as the natural source of light for night man has invented many sources of light such as an electric bulb torch candle or lamps and many more let us now understand light in detail light from the source spread out in all the possible directions do you know how we are able to see the things around us when light from sources of light enters our eyes we see the things this light can be emitted by the object as in case of an electric bulb or from the burning words it can also be the light bonds in of an object like book cat on the table the light amide from any of the light source can never travel in ace manner around the object light travels along straight lines in medium or in accumthe part of light changes only when there is an object in its part or where the medium changes we call this rectilinear propagation of light when use went on at torch in the dark light appears to go straight outwards also light from the sine project that takes straight fat to the screen these observations also show that light travels in straight line let us understand rectilinear propagation of light through activities we see lighted candle on the table look at through or rubber em of about the dysentima ter in length what do you observe we observe that we are able to see the lighted candle as long as to is kept straight what happens to see bend the tube will you see the candle now we cannot see the candle now light cannot bend along the tube like what are flowing through the tube let us to when more active day the three racandealyces of cardboard make fine holes and them at its sale the same level we them stands tray on at table using wooden support we alighted candle on the table with the flame and the level of the holes and us the card boat in such away that candle flame can be seen through these holes this shows that fecan only be seen when the holes are exactly in he straight line what happens of position of one of the cardboard is disturbed if position of any of the cardboard is disturbed we will no longer be able to see the candle flame again on placing the cardboard to its original position the candle flame can be seen this property of light to travel in straight line is called rectilinear propagation of light,"['light changes', 'light source', 'dark light', 'bulb torch candle', 'light', 'straight', 'bright room', 'dark room', 'rectilinear propagation', 'accumthe part', 'ace manner', 'book cat', 'possible directions', 'night man', 'things visible', 'candle', 'many', 'day', 'bulb', 'torch', 'changes', 'source', 'sine', 'part', 'things']"

Rusting of Iron, you might have notice of film or deposit of reddish brown substance on the surface of iron objects such as gates bicycle chains chairs bridges et cetera when they are test an open for long have you ever wondered what the days and hours at formed this the reddish brown substance formed on iron objects in the presence of air and moisture is called rust the process and fat in rust formation is called rusting rusting of iron is ar chemical chains the presence of air or oxygen and water or water wapers is essential for rusting of iron lets perform an experiment to demonstrate the process of rusting of iron and the conditions essential for it for this we require three test tubes atestubestand three iron nails rubber called and high dress cation curie oil boiled water and normal water please three test tubes in atestubestand and label them as and sea put to clean iron nail in each of them in test tube at some boiled water and then pore little oil into it in the test tube at and high dress cation cloride and closed mouth with the rubber cork in the test tube see at normal water keep the test tube aside for a few days observe the testubes after of few days no rust is formed on the nails kept in testube and be while rust can be seen on the nail kept in tested sea let us find the reasons behind these different observations rust is not formed on the iron nail kept in the test tube because the boiled water is not contain oxygen and the oil prevented the entry of more oxygen into the testube no rust is seen on the surface of iron nail kept in the dry air in the test tube be because the anhydrous calcium chloride and absorb the moisture from the damp air present in the test tube when made it drive all free from water rust is formed on the iron nail kept in the test up sea because it is exposed to both air and water from this experiment we can conclude that the presence of air and moisture is essential for rusting of iron chemically rust is hydrated iron three oxide which is formed by the attack of oxygen and water way per present in air on the surface of iron do you know the speed of rusting depends on the amount of moisture that comes in contact with the rusting object more is the humidity in air faster is the rusting of iron this is wide the rusting of ships as ar mature problem in the shopping industry because apart of the ship is always an contact with salty water and humid air presence of salt in the water and humidity in the air together make the roses of rusting faster hence the rust et parts of the ship must be replace from time to tin as we have learned that air and moisture both are necessary for rusting so the rusting of iron objects can be prevented by applying ar protective coating on their surface to white contact with air and moisture painting oiling and greasing are the most common methods used for preventing rusting of iron when he thin layer of other metals like in for chromium as applied on th iron objects the are protected from rusting the process of depositing the layer of zinc and iron is called galvanisation let us learn about galvanisation and detail it is aprosess of depositing alair of zinc on iron by dipping the iron object and molten sing for example iron pipes use in houses are galvanic to avoid rusting car frames are galvanised to avoid rusting on coming in contact with salty water do you know stainless tile used to make cokuair cutlery surgical instruments riches at cetera is made by mixing iron with carbon and metals like nickel chromium and mannans this is because iron articles rust readily while stainless steel is rust resisting let summarise what we have learned the process of deposition of are reddish brown substance on iron in the presence of moisture and air is called rusting air and moisture both are necessary for rusting some of the methods used to prevent rusting of iron include painting oiling greasing and galvanisation galvanisation is the process of depositing a thin layer of zinc metal on iron objects,"['iron nails rubber', 'iron pipes', 'iron object', 'iron objects', 'iron', 'dress cation curie oil', 'water rust', 'rust et', 'cutlery surgical instruments', 'observations rust', 'air', 'dress cation', 'bicycle chains', 'water', 'et', 'object more', 'thin layer', 'common methods', 'white contact', 'protective coating', 'shopping industry', 'more oxygen', 'few days', 'conditions essential', 'rust', 'stainless', 'painting', 'mature', 'calcium', 'test', 'brown', 'chains', 'oil', 'rubber', 'nails', 'methods', 'layer', 'other', 'contact', 'essential', 'oxygen', 'days']"
Effect of change of temperature on ice, what do you understand by the physical change or physical change is at type of change in which the physical appearance of the matter is altered but no new substance is formed for example melting of ice stretching of rubber band et cetera here we will perform an activity to observe the effect of change in temperature on ice for this we need few ice cubes aspirit lamp trip old stand and the wire gas take ar beaker filled with ice cubes now place the beaker on he trip at stand and heated what do you observe the ice cubes start melting slowly observe after some time the ice cubes are completely converted into water what will happen if we heat this water the water slowly starts changing into vapours let us cool these vapours what did you observe slowly these vapours start changing into aliquid form that is water now allow this water to cool for some time by keeping it inside refrigeratr take out the beaker and notice the water has changed into ice from this activity we can conclude that on heating ice which is the solid state of water is converted into liquid which is the liquid state of water on for the heating of water liquid changes into water vapours which is the gaseous state of water as no new substance is formed on heating ice and only the state changes therefore heating of ice is the physical change,"['liquid state', 'trip old', 'band et', 'water liquid', 'ice', 'water vapours', 'new substance', 'state', 'physical', 'liquid', 'trip', 'vapours', 'water', 'example']"
To observe the coloured layer on cut fruits and vegetables, fresh fruits and vegetables are essential to keep ourselves healthy let us cut some of them and observe if they undergo any change even without cooking for this we will take some potatoes apples tomatoes cucumber banana and brinjo or egg plant with the help of knife cut them into small pieces and keep them in separate bolts leave them in open air for some time what do you observe the pieces of potatoes apples brinjo or egg plant and banana turned brown or black on exposure to wear whereas no changes observed in case of tomato and cucumber do you know why the cut pieces of apple brinjo potato and banana react with oxygen present in air they undergo oxidation which is indicated by the formation of brown or black layer on their surface so we can conclude that it is an example of chemical change as he new substance is formed,"['apples tomatoes cucumber banana', 'separate bolts', 'egg plant', 'fresh fruits', 'pieces', 'banana', 'apples', 'cucumber', 'open', 'change']"

To observe the changes when some materials are burnt, what do you understand by a chemical change he chemical change is he type of change which results in the formation of any new substance let us understand it by burning a few substances for this we need a small wooden stick he piece of paper cotton ball and a candle take a small wooden stick and burn it with the help of a candle what did you notice the wooden stick becomes black in colour which on further heating forms ash now take a piece of paper and burn it with the help of a candle what did you notice the piece of paper becomes black in colour and a new material is formed which is called ash take cotton and burn it with the help of a candle did you notice any change yes cotton becomes black in colour and forms a new material called ash from this activity we can conclude that on burning of small wooden stick paper and cotton a new material is formed which is black in colour and also the size and shape of the new material is different from the original material therefore burning of wood or paper or cotton is a chemical change,"['wooden stick paper', 'new material', 'heating forms', 'paper cotton', 'wooden stick', 'chemical change', 'material', 'forms', 'new', 'cotton', 'paper', 'change']"
Reaction between copper sulphate and iron is a chemical change, here we will perform an activity to understand that reaction between copper sulphate and iron nail is he chemical change for this activity we need test tubes iron nails and copper sulphate solution take an iron nail in a test tube add small quantity of copper sulphate solution in it and leave it for a day observe it next day did you notice any change the blue coloured slution of copper sulphate changes too light green and the reddish brown layer of copper is deposited on the iron nail it happens because iron is phase above copper in the metal activity series and is more reactive than copper iron displaces copper from copper sulphate solution in this activity we have observed that the product of the reaction between copper sulphate and iron our iron sulphate and copper it is a permanent change and we see a change in colour of solution from blue to light green properties of iron sulphate are totally different from that of copper sulphate therefore we conclude that reaction between copper sulphate and iron nail is a chemical change,"['iron sulphate', 'copper iron', 'copper sulphate', 'iron', 'small quantity', 'brown', 'green', 'coloured', 'change', 'activity', 'copper', 'test']"
Reaction between baking soda and vinegar is a chemical change, let us perform an activity to understand that the reaction between baking soda and vinegar is he chemical change for this we need to balloon small funnel baking soda vinegar teaspoon and to clean empty bottle put three teaspoon of baking soda in the balloon with the help of he funnel now take a bottle and fill one third of it with vinegar next we will fit the balloon carefully over the mouth of the bottle without dropping baking soda in the vinegar pull the balloon in such a way that the baking soda falls into the vinegar what did you observe the effervescences start appearing in the bottle due to which the balloon starts blowing do you know the reason behind it it is because when baking soda is mixed with vinegar carbon dioxide gas is liberated which blows up the balloon during this process the products formed can not be converted back into the reactions so from this activity waking conclude that the reaction between baking soda and vinegar is achemical change,"['vinegar carbon dioxide', 'soda vinegar', 'small funnel', 'vinegar', 'change', 'soda', 'funnel', 'empty']"
Iron rod turning red hot on heating, physical change is the change in which there is no change in the chemical composition of an object and no new substance is formed or physical change is identified by the change in the physical properties such as the shape since colour et cetera let us understand this by taking an example of an iron rod iron rod on heating turns red but the chemical composition of the iron rod remains the same by hammering this red heart in rod repeatedly will be able to give different shapes to it however no new substance is formed from it it shows that the heating of the iron rod is physical change,"['turns red', 'physical properties', 'chemical composition', 'et', 'red', 'physical']"
Burning of magnesium ribbon is a chemical change, chemical changes are the changes in which new substances are formed and these changes cannot be reverse by reversing the conditions burning of paper is an example of a chemical change do you know how on why chemical change is form an end and irreversibl change the new substances smoke ash gases etcetera are formed with entirely diffean properties during the chemical change the inocusiabolt in the form of heat and light some more examples of chemical changes are the changing of colour of lane ripening of fruits burning of candle bursting of crackeris et cetera let us perform an activity to understand the chemical change with the help of magncian ribbon for this activity we need as spirit lamp a match box a strip of magnesium ribbon a watch glass and ar pair of tongs first like the spirit lamp with the help of a max take now all the strip of magnesium ribbon with the help of a pair of tongs and bring it to the flame we observe that the magnetian ribbon burns with the dazzling white flame when the magnesium ribbon completely burns ar white coloured substance is formed do you know what it is the white coloured substance is magnetian oxide magnetiam oxide is formed by the reaction of magnetian metal and oxygen and it is completely different from the magnesia an oxygen from this activity we can conclude that the burning of magneian ribbon is he chemical change,"['magnetian ribbon', 'white coloured', 'magnetian oxide', 'ribbon', 'spirit lamp', 'candle bursting', 'more examples', 'diffean properties', 'new substances', 'white', 'magnetian', 'et', 'gases', 'chemical', 'oxide', 'match']"
Chemical reactions involve chemical changes, or chemical change is to change in white different substances combine with the code to form one or more new substances this is the form an and change that can of be reverse this change is achieved by chemical reactions are chemical reaction is to process in white new substances when new properties are formed for example burning of he candle rusting of firing etcetera many chemical reactions take late while we could food they prove the tags and of beans of the food ear it so of protein when we go cage their lequecontent changes into solid mass it is he chemical change as the structure of protein molecule changes during cooking letters prepare or gate in order to prepare ocate we need capa sugar butter making poda and eggs when we make these ingredients in the desired proportion and be them in an oven are chemical reaction apes and the gate is prepared the ingredients which are used as the starting material of this chemical reaction are called reactions these ingredients when mixed together form one substance called product here take is the product of the chemical reaction properties of products are in tile different from those of the reactants see this gate is firm soft and tastes nice than the interact will reactions the formation of this gate is abomonanchange bicuswecan ages the original ingredients backfrom gate by any method let us see one more chemical reaction and try to identified reactions and products this is the reaction of citrical react with sodium carbonate the sodium carbonate in atestial and add atricorecacc at to at due will observe bobs that up predated on ate acid to the base the visingis due to the release of carbon dioxide gas this chemical reaction can be represented by wordticwation which is as follows as it last metal carbonate gives the metal sort plus water last carbon dioxide here htriclorecaced plasodium carbonate give sodium chloride plus water blast carbon dioxide the plain indicates that it rical recacit is reacting with sodium carbonate and arrow indicates the direction of the reaction here atrio ric acid is reacting with sodium carbonate to start the chemical reaction so these are the reactants of this chemical reaction and sodium chloride water and carbon dioxide are formed during the chemical reaction so these are rated as the product this reaction is also ar chemical change because the properties of products are completely the fed from that of the reactions and we can aged the reactions that from the product by any means,"['water last carbon dioxide', 'last metal carbonate', 'chemical reaction', 'many chemical', 'ingredients backfrom', 'molecule changes', 'carbon dioxide', 'chemical', 'tastes nice', 'firm soft', 'starting material', 'cooking letters', 'solid mass', 'new', 'ric', 'bicuswecan', 'sugar', 'carbonate', 'reaction', 'metal', 'different', 'ingredients', 'changes', 'water', 'citrical']"
To Investigate a change of state, matter can change its state when we heat or cooled let us understand it with the help of an activity for this we require a candle small empty in spirit burner try board stand and wire gas take he candle and break it up to remove the strings now please the wax in the tin and heat what did you observe the solid candle wax starts melting and after some time it completely changes into liquid be careful do not over heat the wax because on strong heating for long time fumes are formed and these fumes made night now take off the spirit burner and observe what happens to the melted candle wax the melted candle wax solidifies from above activity we can conclude that when energy is added to the solid candle wax the particles start moving faster and it melts and changes into liquid whereas when energy is taken out or removed from the melted candle wax the particles start moving slowly and it solidifies,"['candle wax', 'candle small', 'wire gas', 'spirit burner', 'candle', 'time', 'wax', 'strong']"
Characteristics of Chemical Changes, futusentesses is aprocess by which green plants make their own food during potosentesces green plants combine water and carbon dioxide in the presence of chloro fill and sunlight to prepare to new substances name la blue cos and oxygen gas since the proses of futusantesses involves formation of new substances therefore it is achemical change ar change in which and new substance with different properties is formed is called achemical change so that is learn about the characteristics of chemical changes in detail here are some of the characteristics of chemical changes ar chemical change is ap permanent an irreversible change the composition of or substance changes by chemical change in ac chemical change energy is either given out or absorbed by the system so how chanwe identify achemical change ar chemical change can be identified by the evolution of gas heat light or any other radiation released or absorbed change of code production of sound and change in node lets perform some activities to understand how achemical change can be identified to begin we will perform an activity to understand that the reaction between copesulfate and iron nail is achemical change for this activity we need testubes iron nails and copeselphate solution take an iron nail in aces tube at a small quantity of copesulfate solution in end and leave it for a date observe it the next day do you notice any change the blue coloured solution of copper sulphate changes to light green and aridish brown layer of copper is deposited on the iron an it happens because iron is placed above copper in the litre chemical series and is more reactive than copper iron displaces copper from copper sulphate solution in this activity we have observed that the product of the reaction between copper sulphate and iron is in sulphate and copper it is ar permanent change and we can see at change in collar of solution from blue to light greange properties of iron sulphate or completely different from that of copesalfhate therefore we can conclude that the reaction between copesalfate and iron nail is achemical change now we will perform an activity to demonstrate that the reaction between baking soda and vinegar is also achemical change for this we require aballoon apanel baking soda vinegar teaspoon and aclean empty bottle out three ties pons of baking soda in ar balloon with the help of fa funnel now take ar bottle and fill von tet of fit with vinegar next we vi fic the balloon carefully over the mouth of the bottle without dropping baking soda in the vinegar now pool the balloon in such away that the baking soda falls into the vinegar what did you observe the effervescences start appearing in the bottle due to which the balloon starts blowing do you not the reason behind it it is because when baking soda is mixed with vinegar carbon daside gas is liberated which blows up the balloon during this process the products formed cannot be converted back into the reactions so from this activity we can conclude that the reaction between baking soda and vinegar is also achemical change if the carbon dioxide gas evolved during bthe chemical reaction of baking soda and vinegar is passed through line water the line water turns mil at it is due to the formation of calcium carbonate which is an insoluble white solid this reaction is also used as the test for detecting the presence of carbon dioxide let can sides are more examples of chemical changes burning of substances such as paper wood or cool is always accompanied by the production of heat light and gases some cut fruits and vegetables sternground when exposed to air for some time bosting of firecrackers produces heat light sound and unpleasant gases aa men is produce whenever food is foil proto sentees in planes tigition of food and coding of mild are some more examples of chemical changes now can difference chemical changes from physical changes yes physical changes can be usually reverse on the other hand chemical changes can not be reversed by simple meters physical changes do not involve the formation of new substances while in the chemical changes new substances with different properties are formed ar physical change is temporary whereas achemical change is permanent to summarise at the end we can star a chemical change is permanent and irreversible during a chemical change the chemical composition of substance changes and energy is either given out or absorbed by the system such changes can be identified by the evolution of gas heat light or any other radiation released or absorbed change of colour production of sound and change in order,"['chemical changes ar chemical change', 'change ar chemical change', 'change ar change',

Motion and its Types, every day you see numerous objects around you such as your school bag as study table an aquarium pendulum clock electric fans of football and car now caticarise which of these are moving in which are at rest but the question is on what bases to be decide where than an object is in motion or at rest to understand this consider is situation where your friend chason is travelling in ac car when jason looks at the objects inside the car he finds as if car is not moving at the same time his friend can standing out of the car finds that car changes its position in certain time with respect to him how is this possible having the scene car be at rest as well as in motion at the same time it is because both the rest and motion are relative and depends on the state of the observer thus an object is said to be in motion if when changes its position with the respect to observer in a given time on the other hand if an object does not change its position with respect to an observer in agiven time then it is at rest so now you are clear than on what bases you have classified the objects in motion and at rest to the object such as pendulum clock all electric fan move from one place to another no motor objchanging their position with the respect to time have you notes movement in any of their parts yes the blades of the fan pendulum of the clock mons is there motion similar to that of part no all these show different types of motion to understand such type of differences in motion let us learn some types of motion you may have observed the soldier march fast in aperade they walk in as straight line similarly you may have noticed the motion of we cells on straight road sprinters running on straight track by trapping of ball from the top of abuilding in all the cases objects move along the straight line such type of motion in which an object moves along straight line is known as rectilinear motion after learning about rectilinear motion let us now learn another type of motion for this take aball attached with the string and or it with your hand what do you notice about the motion of the stone the stone moves along the circular path and its direction continuously changes with time the distance of the stone from the hand remain same so whenever an object moves in acelcular part it is said to be in sulcular motion in case of moving fan if the point is mark on one of the blades of the fan or the hands of the clock then the motion of the marked points are examples of circular motion though the motion of blades of the fan is said to be rotational motion in both the cases the objects are not moving from their place and the distance of the point part from the sente remains the same the motion of aperson sitting in aculcular gind wheel and the motion of an athlete around the circular track are some other examples of circular motion let us now learn about another type of motion take aball with the string attached to it hold the strength such that ball hands take the ball to one side and release it the ball comes into motion the ball continuously moves to and fro this type of motion in which an object repeats its motion after of fixed time interval is known as periodic motion can you think of some examples of periodic motion you most have in joined sitting on as swing the motion of swing is periodic similarly the motion of all orbiting around the sun is also an example of periodic motion so far you have learned aboubrectily near motion circular motion and periodic motion but can an object possess ar combination of more than one type of motion yes an object can have more than one type of motion simultaneously to understand this consider th situation where of football is line on the ground on kick ink of football it starts rolling on the ground if we observe it carefully the football possesses two types of motion while rolling it is moving along as straight line as well as rotating along its axis thus we can say that rolling ball undergoes acombination of rotational as well as rectilinear motion so motion is everywhere around us from the blood flowing inside or body to the rotation of moon going around the earth,"['motion circular motion', 'motion take aball', 'circular motion', 'pendulum clock electric', 'object possess ar', 'ball hands take', 'motion', 'object such', 'fan pendulum', 'electric fan', 'pendulum clock', 'straight road', 'time', 'take aball', 'soldier march', 'different types', 'notes movement', 'friend chason', 'study table', 'school bag', 'numerous objects', 'such', 'circular', 'gind', 'part', 'other', 'car', 'fan', 'clock', 'straight', 'object', 'marked', 'hands', 'ball', 'types', 'friend', 'objects', 'situation']"

Availability and Forms of Water, do you know which day is celebrated on twenty second march yes it is the world water day since we know that water is the natural resource can you gets the reason for se liberating world water dy well this days liberated to at we can the sustainable management of fresh water resources let us know more about the importance of water water is one of the most precious resources of our planet earth which is also known as the blue planet do you know why well the earth looks blue when seen from space becaseventy one per cent of the earth surfas is covered with water water is essential for all living beings to sustain life and the amount of water ric wire may be re according to the size of the organisms we use water for various purposes such as drinking who king food cleaning utensils washing clothes bathing brushingtat at cetera no try to observe the amount of water that is used in all these daily cos in your house per day then calculate the amount of water utilise by each per in in your house by using this data you will find that it is impossible to spent as single day without water since water is one out the integral parts of our lives the united nations has recommended fifty ly dees for per in for day as the amount of water to be used for various day to day activities and for maintaining good personal high gene this quantity is about to when the half waters of water or person per day but do you know that althowater is as cential for our survival millions of people even in our country re living in areas where there is scarcity of water or short edge of water so what hot come to your mind when you hear or read about water scarcity the moment we hear all read of water shortites we instantaneously visualise the deserts of rates and and people carrying or then potent travelling long distances to get water due to this scarcity of water muselike long cues force acting water march is bites and protease can be commonly heard or seen especially during the summer season surprisingly not just an in tea this problem of water shapes experience by people throughout the world moreover according to an estimate over one heard of the world population could face this proflem in afew years from now before we deal into the concept of water scarcity let us know about the availability of water on earth do you know how water is distributed on our planet well the distribution of water on the earth surface is extremely uneven the water on earth is metally contained in seas lakes rivers oceans iscaps underground and in the atmosphere out of the total available water inthes seven per cent or salty water and only re per cent is fresh water out of the total amount of available fresh water to per cent is in is caps and glaciers and only one per cent is available for human consumption let us now for form an activity to have are five tear of the relative amount of water present in different sources of water for this activity you will require are medium sized baki are teaspoon of five milli litre capacity about mad or last and twenty leaters of water to profound this activity fill the bucket wave twenty leaters of water and as you met as the total amount of water on earth you think the teaspoon of five mililitr capacity transfer andredspoons of water in the both magas you met as the total amount of fresh water on earth now from the both mad transfer thirtaspoons of water to the glass this represents the water present as ground water at last we draw ar water spoon full of water from the mug this represents the water present in rivers and lakes of the word hence we can conclude that the water left in the bucket is the line water which is made truly available in oceans seas and partly as ground water this water is not considered save for human consumption secondly the water left in the but mark represents the water available in the form of ice and glaciers ice caps and form an ends snow this water is safe for use but is not readily available so far we have learned that only the fresh water is fit for human consumption but do you know the sources of fresh water yes the fresh water is mainly obtained from surface run off and ground water that is continually being renewed and recharged through are continuous circulation of water in the earth atmosphere system wire of cycle involving various processes this cycle is known as the water cycle let us understand the cycle in detail water cycle begins where the evaporation of water from the surface of the ocean sea lakes forns et cetera these water vapours arise into the atmosphere and condenses to form tiny water droplets that combine to form clouds when clouds become heavy precipitation outer is in the form of rain drizzle leaks pale or snow as the water falls on the ground it flows over the earth surfes this run of water combines and forms rivers la channels and ends up in seeds and oceans this way the water is carried bactoits sources and thus the cycle continues some of the precipitated water in filtrates into the soil and increases the ground water level do you know that even plants contribute to the water cycle well the plants contribute to the water cycle by transpiration it is the process and with the water in the form of water vapours is released through tomater present in leaves and stems so far it is clear that when the water circulates through the water cycele it can be found in three forms that are solid liquid and gas let us now learn about these forms of water available in different sources the solid form that is snow or ice is present as snow covered mount tens glaciers and polar ice caps water in liquid form is available in oceans rivers lakes and underground the gaseous form of the water denotes the water vapour in the air around as the continuous cycling of water into these three forms helps in maintaining the total amount of water on the earth has constant even when it is extensively used by us to do you think that water will always be plentiful well the answer is now nearly one third of the world population as living in areas where there is scarcity of water or shortage of water and increase in the population rise in the number of industrees and expansion of agriculter are the major reasons for water scarcity water is used for various purposes that has drinking cooking food cleaning utensils washing clothes leaving brush in teeth at cetera the water on earth is maturely contained in seas lakes rivers oceans ice caps underground and in the atmosphere it can be found in three forms that are solid liquid and gas the water cycle refers to the continuous circulation of water in the earth atmosphere system that is regulated through are cycle involving various processes

Sources of Water, water is the most essential resource for the existence of living organisms on the earth nearly seventy one percent of the earth surfaces covered with water natural sources of water are divided into three broad categories which are rain water surface water and ground water water vapours present in the air condenses to form clouds and come down as ring it forms the part of the water cycle rains snow tail and sleep which fall on the earth surface are considered as meteorological water they are sometimes considered as the original source of all the water present on the earth green water falling on the earth surface is collected as surface water and underground water surface water on earth and compasses the water present in the form of oceans sees rivers lakes streams and bones water present in the rivers and lakes comes from rain and melting of now on mountains rivers eventually flow into the sea some water in water falling on the earth surface seeps through the soil and gets collected below the ground the water thus collected is called ground water water collected underground forms the water table the level of water varies according to the place in season round water is obtained through wells and springs wells are formed by digging the earth surface till it reaches the impervious rocks due to heat and pressure inside the earth sometimes water ooses out from the earth in form of springs ground water is drawn out through hand pumps and due wells and is used for daily cos and agriculture water is an important resource that must be used carefully as it supports life on earth,"['water water', 'round water', 'underground water', 'water natural', 'water', 'springs wells', 'original source', 'snow tail', 'air condenses', 'broad categories', 'living organisms', 'resource', 'earth', 'wells', 'springs', 'underground', 'rivers']"

subtraction is called comparison by differens now can you compare the prizes of the gold ring and the silver ring shown here on taking difference of their prizes you will find that the gold ring is forty nine thousand five hundred rupees costlier than the silver ring consider another example on comparing the weight of apumpkin to that of ar potato by taking the difference you will find that the pumpkin is four thousand three hundred fifty grams heavier than the potato do these differences show in appropriate comparison no be is the difference is two large and bootases in such situations we use comparison by division on dividing the price of the gold ring by that of the silver ring we get hundred upon one and this means that the price of the gold ring is hundred times the prize of the silver ring how many times the weight of apumpkin is that of the weight of ar potato on dividing the weight of the pumpkin by that of the potato we find that the weight of the pumpkin is thirty times the weight of the potato comparison of two contities in terms of how many times which is done by using division is called ratio it is denoted by using the colon simple so we can say that the ratio of the price of the gold ring to the price of the silver ring is hundred estto one and the ratio of the weight of the pumpkin to the weight of the potato is thirtyis to one there thirty and one are called the terms of the ratio since the ratio is only comparison or a relation between two contoties so it is cos the number with no unit for instance the ratio of thirtyculo grams to ten kilograms is three is to one and not three kilograms is to one kilogram hence we say that ar ratio has no unit lets learn more about ratios through an example height of anal mirror is two meters and the height of aside table is thirty centimetres what is the ratio of the height of the side table to that of the almirah you must be thinking that the require ratio is thirty divided by two which is equal to fifteen is to one it means that the height of the side table is fifteen times the height of the almirah is it even possible now so where did we go wrong observe that the height of the side table is in centimetres and that of the almirah is in meters so we have to convert their heights into the same unit and then compare height of the almirah in sent imaters is two hundred centimetres therefore the ratio of the height of the side table to the height of the mirror is given by thirty divided by two hundred which is equal to three is to twenty it means that the height of the side table is three upon twenty times the height of the al mirror it leads to an important conclusion about ratio that two contitys can be compared only if they are in the same unit now what is the ratio of the height of the al mirror to the height of the side table ich is given by two hundred divided by thirty which is equal to twenty is to three note that the two ratios twenties to three and three is to twenty are different from each other can you tell why it is because their terms are in reverse order and order of terms is important in artio to you want to learn more lens go ahead row my and manu on to have better lets divide the beside to eight equal parts and share it between rani and manner in the ratio of two is to six the ratio two is to six can be retenas two upon six which is equal to one upon three we know that two upon six and one upon three are called equavelent fractions similarly we call the ratios to is to six and one is to three as equivalent ratios thus for a given ratio is to be we can get the equvalint ratios by multiplying or dividing the terms ea and be by the same nonsier number for example the equivalent ratios of the ratio sixes to eight can be found one py multiplying the terms of the ratio with two and also by dividing the terms of the ratio by two thus six is to eight twelve is to sixteen and three is to for all are equivalent ratios now lets work out of problem on sharing things in a given ratio forty chocolates are distributed between berry and jacob in the ratio threes to five find how many does each get two terms of the ratio three is to five are three and five these terms represent the two parts some of these parts is eight why did we calculate this sum because this sum tells us that berry gets three parts and jacob gets five parts out of the eight equal parts so berry gets three upon eight of the total number of chocolates that is fifteen chocolates and jacob gets five upon eight of the total number of chocolates that is twenty five chocolates hope you have understood the concept of ratios its time to crab some extra information by is aspecial ratio in mathematics represented by greekalphabet as shown here it is the ratio of the

Application of Percentage, application of per cent age in our day to day life we use percentages in many ways for example number of houses nearer beach increased by fifteen per cent last year nearly twenty seven per cent students of primary school do not each fruit daily the humidity of city at nine am was forty six per cent and at three p m was eighty eight per cent the number of children of city attending the cinema during examdays has dropped by ninety five per cent per cent age is used for i catching grafts a percentage is aspecial kind of fraction the denominator in such a fraction is always hundred for example three out of five can be written as three upon five all sixty upon hundred or simply sixty per cent lets consider a situation sam wants to purchase of jacket that costs at most one twenty five dollars he was at at the garments show room and found there is twenty five per cent of on jacket he selected three jackets of am arc one seventy five dollars one seventy dollars and one sixty five dollars out of these three jackets which jacket he can buy these three jackets after this count will cost him one twenty one point two five dollars one twenty seven point five zero dollars and one twenty three point seven five dollars so he can buy the jacket with am ar one sixty five dollars which will cost him one twenty three point seven five dollars thus percentage is very helpful in our daily life,"['cent last', 'cent', 'am arc', 'aspecial kind', 'primary school', 'example number', 'many ways', 'nearer', 'life', 'example', 'number', 'am']"
Conversion of Percentage to Decimals and Vice-Versa, when you go to arestauron to eight you might pay as so this charge on the be as service charge is an extra charge added to the ball the extra amount that you pay is always percentage of the ball suppose you dine in arrestauron where the service charge is fifteen per cent of the ball and you or to upombomel prize at rupee five hundred when you check out fifteen per cent of rupee five hundred would be added to your bell how much would you pay in total to on so this question you should know others it mean by fifteen per cent of ive hundred you probably already know that of behaves as the multiplication of rated so fifteen per cent of five hundred means fifteen per cent multi live ive five hundred to simplify this you need to convert fifteen per cent in to fraction or at decimal you have already studied the conversion of per cent into fraction but do you know how to convert fifteen per cent into at decimal lets learn how to do it you have studied that fifteen per cent means fifteen out of one hundred per cent plate fifteen upon one hundred and you might already know that fifteen upon one hundred is equal to zero point on five now we multiply zero point one five with five hundred and get seventy five so the service charge is rupee seventy five and the total amount paid by you would be rupee five hundred plus rupee seventy five that is tropics five hundred seventy five in general to convert upper cent into ar decimal the first step is to write the per cent as ar fraction of one hundred and then convert the fraction obtained in to decimal lets quickly convert some percentages into decimals twenty six per cent equals twenty six upon one hundred which is equal to zero point to cats ity per cent equals eightyupon one hundred or eight upon ten which is equal to zero point at can you write to hundred thirty five per cent as at decimal of course you can to hundred thrtyfive per cent equals to hundred thirty five upon one hundred which is equal to two point three five what if you want to go the other way round and convert at decimal into ar per cent can you convert zero point zerrsix into per cent you have studied that zero point zero six can be retent in fractional form as six upon one hundred now you know that to convert ar fraction in to per cent multiply it by hundred per cent and thin simply five on multiplying six upon one hundred by one hundred per cent we get six per cent in general to convert at decimal in to ar per cent the ferstep is to re the decimal in fractional form the next step is to multiply the fraction obtained by hundred per cent and then simply five lets quickly convert some decimals to percentages zero point nine five equals ninety five upon one hundred on multiplying it by one hundred per cent we get zero point nine five equals ninety five per cent for point three equals forty three upon tent on multiplying it by one hundred per cent we get for point three equals four hundred thirty per cent now lets work out problem suppose that you want to ive offemacre that cause thrupies four thousand ichis on sale at twenty per cent of how much would it cost on sail to find it out multiply the original price by twenty per cent twenty per cent equals twenty upon one hundred which is equal to zero point to zero zero point to zero times rupees four thousand is rupee eight hundred which is the is count so the sale prices will be rupee four thoucent mine as rupee eight hundred or rupee three thouscento hundred alternatively you could multiply the original price by eighty per cent and get the same once we cause you will only pay eighty per cent of the original prizes to arrive at eightepercent you would supra the twenty per cent is found from ve this work because one is the seen as one hundred per cent or the whole which is the pre sail ive thus we can can you that all the parts that on the whole when added to get give the whole or one hundred per cent so if we are given one part wicanalbys find out by other pad suppose fifty five per cent of travellers in at tracing group have as sleeping bag what person pof the travellers to not have sleeping bags this means that iftherever one hundred travellers fifty five out of them would have sleeping bat and the remaining would not then the number of traverse without sleepinbav would be one hundred mine as fifty five per cent which is equal to forty five per cent its time to find at to convert a person into a decimal write the person as affraction of one hundred and then convert the fraction to decimal to convert a decimal into a person write the decimal as affraction then multiply the fraction obtained by one hundred percent and simplify to obtain the percent we also learnt that all the

Measuring Line Segments, you have learnt three methods to compare line segments these methods can only be used to find whether al line segment is longer or shorter than the other these methods are not useful where we want to know by how much line segment is longer than the other let us learn to measure the length of line segments for the is an opening up your timetrybarks you will notds at two straight edged object called ar ruler it has sentiment remarks on one edge and inch marks on the other edge it is divided into fifty equal parts of one centimetre each along one of its edges each centimetre is for the divided into ten equal parts of one millimetre so one centimetre is equal to ten millimetres how many millimetres equal to two centimetres twenty millimetres also then millimetres is equal to one sentimter therefore one millimetre is equal to one upon ten sentimeters or zero point one centimetre how many centimetres equal to millimetres zero point two centimetre now what do we mean by for point to centimetres for point to sentimeters mean ar length of four sentimeters and two millimetres we will now use the ruler to measure the length of the line segment ab to measure ab please edge with the sentimeters mark of the ruler along the line sentmentab in such away that point day of the line segment coincides with the zero mark on the ruler then we the mark on the ruler against point be the mark on the ruler at point be indicates five centimetres thus the length of the line segment ab is five centimetres or we can write it as shown here lets measure the length of the line segment bu please the ruler as than before you coin sides with the smaller mark of the ruler line between seven and eight that is the sixth mark then we say that the length of is seven point six centimetres or seven centimetres and six millimetres can you compare the length of these two line segments by measuring with the ruler yes the length of cd is for point centimetres and the length of ex vis the point nine centimetres thus we say that cd is longer the next wide this method can also be used when you have more than two line segments measure there length with the help of ar ruler and then compare them there is room for errors even in this procedure to get the correct measure the eye should be correctlye position just wortically above the mark otherwise errors can happen due to angular viewing there would also be chances of error if the ruler is as it becomes difficult to read the mark one edge to how do we get rid of such errors we use the rules friend divide suppose we want to measure line segment ab first we take the divide and put its two end point sad the end points of ab now life the divided without disturbing its opening and place it on the ruler thus that one of its arms as an zero mark we the mark agents the other arm of the divide the other end of the divide is at three point two sentimentar mark of the ruler thus the length of the line segment ab is three point to centimetres similarly find the length of the line segment cd we observe that cd is longer than ab in an arc shell by using ruler and divide you can measure and compare line segments accurately,"['measure line segment', 'line segment', 'ruler line', 'end point', 'point centimetres', 'other end', 'line', 'centimetres equal', 'mark', 'such errors', 'correctlye position', 'correct measure', 'next wide', 'inch marks', 'sentiment remarks', 'point', 'other', 'end', 'friend', 'equal', 'centimetres', 'ruler', 'angular', 'errors', 'such', 'measure']"

Conservation of Water, if you wake up one morning with no water supply what would you do you on be able to brush or teeth take ashare or prepare breakfist we can't imagine going to day without water people in many areas was water scarcity water is of valuable natural re so essential for our survival we must conserve this pressures rests for the sake of future generations and the survival of plants and animals lets talk about the conservation of water in more detail or it is also known as the blue planet water covers almos seventy won per cent of the earth surface have you ever that about wide people face water scarcity even though there is plenty of water on the planet to get ap better understanding of it let us first look at the availability of water on earth sees and oceans contain ninety seven point four per cent of all available water on earth we cority of water available on earth as as salty ties and is not fit for human consumption the remaining two points six per cent is fresh water so is this water available for our use well most of the fresh water is frozen and glaciers and polar is caps thus we only have small amount of fresh water available for are utilisation in the form of rivers lakes points and ground water although the quantity of available water remains the same usable water is becoming scarcity by day lets take alook at the reasons for water scarcity one of the most and patent reasons for water scarcity is an increase in population due to population growth the number of in dust trees and agricultural activities have increased this has led to an increase in the consumption of water with an increase in the consumption of water more and more ground water is drawn from well and to well this has decrease the ground wateron level ground water is recharged by the sea page of rain fall when there is no or less ring the ground water becomes cars now as we know about the scarcity and availability of water we must conserve it what do we mean by conservation of water well consuming water means avoiding the vas stage of water and using it efficiently lets talk about how we can save water at home we must turn of the taps when they are not in use we must wash atomobils with water using or bucket instead of for water pine water used for washing vegetables and fro can be reused to water plants cracks and water by plines and leaves and for sets must be fixed there are numerous other ways to conserve water using improvised irrigation systons such as drepirigation helps to red use water consumption winding more dams and reserwirs provides efficient water to vi green water can be conserved using green water harvesting systems let us learn about it green water harvesting is an effective way of water conservation it involves collecting rain water and storing it for future use as well as we charging the ground water there are two methods of rain water harvesting roof top rain water harvesting and surface run off water harvesting let us learn about them one by one in roof top harvesting rain water is collected on the roof of or house or building and is pipe down to an underground storage tank made of concrete the water start in the tank is used when water is cars this stored water may contain soil and other impurities so it must be filtered before use in another method of roof of harvesting rain water collected from the roof is pipe down into and under ground porcolation fit the water is filtered here by stand grave and broken brakes then through an outlet this water seats down into the ground and re charges the ground water the surface run off harvesting method re charges the ground water as well let us now discuss this myths you must have notice that the green water that falls on concrete roots are out buildings and open spaces flows into the nearby trains and mixes wt through edge water the surface run off harvesting method involves collecting grin water that falls on the road and open spaces and allowing it to sleep into the ground so how is it done it is done by constructing deparcollation beds on the road sides and open spaces around buildings the pulcollation pit is filled with filter materials and covered by concrete slabs having holes the fit is connected to ar recharged well through a pipe rain water that falls on the road and in open areas enters the purcollation bit through these holes here water is filtered by sand and gravel which removes all the suspended contaminants from water after filteration water enters the recharged well the water collected in the recharged well gradually seeps into the ground this re charges the ground water ground water can be drawn by tubewell or and pumps for use thus rain water harvesting helps in overcoming the shortage of ground water lets recall what we have learned water may be conserved by reducing the waste age of water building dams and as ar waters harvesting grain water and improving irrigation meters rain water harvesting is an efficient method of conserving water there are two types of rain water harvesting roof top rain water harvesting and surface run off water harvesting roof top rain water harvesting is the process of collecting rain water that falls on roads and storing it for future use as well as recharging ground water surface run off water harvesting involves collecting rain water that falls on roads and open places

Water Cycle Special, water on the earth is constantly moving it re cycles over and over again this movement is called water cycle let us know more about vapours the sun heats up the water and turns it into water waves plants as to lose water fire transpiration this results in and increased amount of will pars in the atmosphere water storage the earth soaked out some water storing it in the ground until it is meaning this storage area is called aquatic we pump water directly from underground aquifers and use it for drinking and other domestic and agricultural purposes clouds when vapours present in the air get called they change back into liquid and form clouds this is called on usation these clouds get heavy and start raining rain precipitation uters when there is an excess of water in the air that it cannot hold any more it will be rain snow or halit first up lakes rivers and oceans found on the surface of the earth,"['water storage', 'water fire', 'water waves', 'rain precipitation', 'purposes clouds', 'water', 'other domestic', 'underground aquifers', 'rain', 'clouds', 'storage', 'vapours']"
Water : Different States, all of us relish ice cold water in scorching summer do you know that is is the solid form of water in fact water exists in three physical states namely solid liquid and gas is is frozen water it is the solid state of water most of the water on earth exists in liquid state steam all water vapour is the gases state of water it is interesting to know that by changing temperature or pressure won state of water can be converted into another some of the processes in fall in the inter conversion of different states of water are evaporation transpiration and condensation lets learn about them one by one beginning with evaporation the process of conversion of water into which to waperses called evaporation lets perform an activity to understand evaporation for this activity we require to beakers of two hundred fifty milleters capacity and water to begin fill boat the beakers with equal amount of water mol the water level in each beaker now please one of the beakers under sun and the other one in the shade observe the water level in the two beakers every houer you will notice that the water from the beaker kept under unlike disappears that afaster rate than from the on which is kept in the shade the water kept in sunlight gets direct heat from the sun and hence converts on to water waper quickly while in the other case the around in air gets heated from the sunlight and this warm air provides heat for the evaporation of water kept in the shade so we can can cough that the process of evaporation takes place at faster rate in the presence of head however evaporation is of spontaneous and slow process many changes that we see around us and daily life ate due to evaporation for instance changes like drawing of washed clothes in air drawing of wet hair and drawing of wet under the fan all involved evaporation of water moving on now we we learn about transpiration we know that plant state and water from the soil plants use some of the water to make their food and stores thumb in their different parts but the remaining is eventually released into ar as water weaker through the surface of leades this process of loss of water from the surface of leaf is known as transpiration we can say that evaporation and transpiration are the two processes through with water wapers are transferred into air on cooling water wapers condenses to form water this process is known as condensation to understand condensation letters perform an activity for this activity we require are table spoon ice cubes are glass and water take the glass and fill it with water now at few is cubes and it and observe the outer walls of the glass carefully you can see water droplets on the outer side of the glass these water droplets have come from the condensation of the water vapour which are present in the air around you might have notes due on glass or spider web in the early morning do you know it is formed due to the condensation of water waper present in the air moreover the formation of clouds is ostia on the process of condensation they remain floating in air and appear to us as clouds some of the condense to water drops become to heavy the all back to the earth in the form of rain hailed we and slow to some up we can say that water exists in three states namely solid liquid and gas by changing can criture all pressure won state of water can be converted into another if operation is the process of conversion of water into wapers transpiration is the process of loss of water from the surface of leaf in the form of wapers condensation is the process of formation of water from waperse on cooling,"['water wapers', 'water waper', 'water', 'solid state', 'process many changes', 'wapers condensation', 'spoon ice', 'different states', 'state', 'spider web', 'notes due', 'soil plants', 'wet hair', 'daily life', 'other case', 'direct heat', 'equal amount', 'milleters capacity', 'inter conversion', 'wapers', 'ice', 'outer', 'air', 'rate', 'solid', 'condensation', 'different', 'states', 'changes', 'process', 'wet', 'due', 'heat', 'other', 'conversion']"
Water : Flood and Drought, at times when it rains we can see colourful rainbow and green re over around children enjoy cling in the rain floating paper boat and damping into the small buds but water if it rains or lie or never rains at all our country experiences rainfall during the monsoonseason it provides great relief to pale fus after the hot summer days farmers eagerly wait for the monsoon to arrive as the growth of several crops is dependent on it however heavy or continuous rain for a few days causes many problems let us discuss some of these problems due to heavy rainfall excess water collects on roads and streets you have probably notice water log roads and streets during the rain season due to rain people find it difficult to travel as the eagles get struck causing traffic cans moreover when it rains continuously the water level and rivers lays and bonds rises and is spread over large land areas which causes floods flood has various harmful effects let us know some effects of of flat during flags cities down villages forests and fields are all submerged to by flood water the furniture and the other items in side our home are damaged this causes destruction of life and property humans and many animals get carried away by the force of heavy floods and tie some aquatic animals flow with water and are trapped on the land when flood water flows down the die animals like earth words ands insects rats and snakes let live in the soil also die thecaus the soil as floded and they are unable to breed floods damage crops as well the roots of natural vegetation are harmed by fast flowing water the top layer of soil is carried away by water leading to soil erosion this makes the soil in for tileslet us know about the other effects of flat floating causes property damage it destroys houses buildings and even other structures such as bridges road ways and canals you have probably seen pictures of cards floating away in flood waters there are also numerous after effects of flood fever flags cause widespread destruction it has an impacts and peoples living conditions which takes are long time to recover crop damage leads to of food shortage and thus increases the prices of food floods also increase the spread of diseases flood water mixes with garbage set and other harmful substances and results and various infections it can dominates drinking water and causes diseases like typhoid and collide we can now understand what happens when there is no rain fall when there is no rain for an extended period of time it causes extreme dry conditions known as drought lets look at what happens during the drought due to no rainfall the level of water in lakes bonds degrees sometimes these water wodies dry completely drouwater level also goes down as there is no water to sleep under the ground thus drought cases scarcity offfresh water let us discuss the effect of drought on soil soil tries under the condition of drought it loses water by evaporation do you know how soil loses water some of the water is lost from the surface of soil as water waper into the atmosphere the processes cue evaporation soil can also lose water in directly through plans by the process of transpiration water from the soil is absorbed by the roots of plants and is lost as water waper from the leaves the processes called transpiration thus due to evaporation and transpiration the water content in the soil decreases the rain restores this water when there is no rain the soil continues to lose water and try out do you know under extreme dry conditions and drought some plants and animals even die due to dehydration people living in drought areas also feet many difficulties the farmers cannot grow crops as the soil is dry and there is no water this leads to food shortage for people in the region of the drought also the vegetation such as grass and other fodder do not grow well this leads to shortage of food fall domestic animals like cows goats and buffaloes some people and animals die as he result of starvation during drought as he result many people living in drought affected areas leave their homes and my great to other locations with their domestic animals let us recall what we have learnt about floods and droughts flood is the overflow of water from rivers lags and borns caused by heavy rain flood cause widespread destruction of life and property drought is he state of dryness in an area caused by a lack of rainfall for the long period of time drought leads to water scarcity and food shortage,"['flood water',

Water: Importance and Sources, we are able to breed fresh air when we are around plants what happens if we do not water are plants for a few days they will and eventually die water is avaluable natural resources that is essential for the survival of all living things whether plants or animals let us discuss how water is important in our lives on an average human require three to four leaters of water for day for drinking forpers it may be ar glass of water in the form of jes or lemonade water not only quenches are fus but is also required for our bodies to function properly it helps in the digestion and removal of waves from our bodies in addition to drinking we require water for every dy of domestic purposes we use water to cook food wash clots and dishes bean flowers brush are tied wave and flushed the toilet let us now look at the use of water in agriculture and industry water is used to grow food farmers culture wheat rides pulses and other food crops in the fields water is required for the irrigation of these crops did you know that it takes approximately fiftenhundred leaters of water to grow wheat plants that produce one culogram of wheat grains water from rivers bonds and lakes is used for fish farming also water helps and seed dispersal as well it transports the seeds of plants that grow near rivers from one location to another this helps and the spread of many plant varieties to remote locations and the industrial scale water is required for the manufacturing and processing of paper chemicals medicins last eggs fertilisers semen and ar variety of other products rapidly moving water is used to generate in ectrocity in hydroelectric our plants water in the form of steam is used to generate electricity in athermal power plant water helps and transportation also as injurs and goods are transported by boat and ships across rivers seas and otions water is used to cool the engines of weakls such as cars bases and tracks now let us understand how important water is to human oceans and seas are the ears largest sore of water did you know that water covers to the of the earth and that oceans and seas contain ninety seven per cent of all water however this water is unfit for human consumption it has the lot of salts dissolved in it as ar result it is very salty and unfit for drinking well purifying sea and ocean water is done by these alanation which is an expensive process we use fresh water from rivers lakes bonds well and few bells these are the main sources of fresh water have you ever thought about how this water reaches the taps in your home well water from rivers lakes bonds wells and few bells is first purified in water treatment plants through ar variety of processes this removes impurities as alas many germs that cause diseases the purified water is then distributed to our homes through network of pines you must have noticed or water by plane connection at your house in villages however people draw water directly from rivers lakes or bells let us now look at how these water bodies are filled with water rivers get their water from snow mountains known as glaciers when these glaciers melts the resulting water flows into rivers rivers receive water from grain as well and some rivers flow in to lakes rain water feeds lakes bones and wells let us learn more about rain water rain water is the purest form of water however as he rain falls to the ground it picks up wearious gases from the atmosphere also when rain water flows into rivers and streams it picks up many impurities and becomes contaminated do you know water ground water is when rain water falls on ground some of it seeds through the soil and is filters as it moves on der the earth surface when this water reaches hard rocks it starts collecting tail this collected water under the ground is called ground water ground water is thus as source of fresh water how do we get this water hand pump or tube well is used to draw ground water wells are the holes dug into the ground to reach ground water water drawn from deep well is usually fit for drinking at some point ground water is gaps and flows to the surface on its own this is known as spring spring water is pure did you know that the oceans provide us with fresh water indirectly through the water cycle water evaporates from the oceans boring water vapour which condenses and falls as rain rain water fills rivers lakes and sweeps into the ground providing us with fresh water as the result saline water from the ocean is converted to fresh water that we use let us recall what we have learnt about in waters and sources of water water is essential for the survival of all living things we use water for drinking and various domestic purposes water is used in agriculture and in dust trees we use fresh water from rivers lakes bonds well and tubewells ocean and sea water is salty and unfit for use rain water is the purest form of water,"['ground water ground water',

Importance of Water, earth is the only planet where life exists do you know why earth looks blue when seen from the space it is because seventy per cent of earth surface is covered with water that is why it is also called the blue planet water is essential for all living beings to sustain life we use water for cooking food giving utensils washing floats et cetera it provides habitat to aquatic plants an anemones besides it is renewable source of energy do you know our bodies to third weight is comprised of water isn't it surprising in fact fruits and vegetables also contain water glands also need water to make them food for the help of sunlight and garden dioxide in the proc has called outer sin testes industries also use water for various purposes you will be wondering to know that fresh water available one is very less therefore we should not waste as single drop of water remember water is precious use it wisely,"['planet water', 'floats et', 'water', 'third weight', 'renewable source', 'aquatic plants', 'food giving', 'earth surface', 'per cent', 'planet', 'food', 'earth']"
To measure the length of the curved line using a thread-3, have you ever tried to measure the outline of leaf can we measure it using the ruler let us now by measuring the length of the gold line using the thread for this experiment were wire a ruler piece of thread as sketch pen apiee of paper and apencil take piece of paper and the pencil draw acid line on the piece of paper using he pencil take thread anti not at at one end place the not made in thread along the one end of the old line ap on stretching the thread on the gold line till you reach the other end of the gold line using sketch pen make mark on the thread at the pines where the gold line ends now take ruler and stretch out the thread along the ruler measure the distance between the two marks on the thread using ruler the length of the gold line is tens and imeders length of the thread between two binds is the length of the gold line thus the length of the gold line can be measured using he thread,"['line', 'sketch pen', 'ruler piece', 'imeders length', 'thread anti', 'end', 'ruler', 'thread', 'length', 'piece']"
Correct Measurement of Length, we generally compare our height with those of our friends to see who is taller than whom if you have to measure your height how will you find it would you use the scale ar meter rod or ameasuring tape for measuring your height here measuring tape is the suitable means to measure height on the other hand if you have to measure the length of to clock piece you have to make use of the metre rod so in order to measure ar length correctly first step is to those in appropriate divides for measurement next step is to find the lend correctly let state this box and find out its lend with the help of scale we the scale straight in contact with the box along its length if the marking on the scale is not visible or it is broken so in this case we can take the measurement from any other visible mark after taking the measurement we must subtract the reading of the initial mark from the reading observed at the end mark for example here the reading of initial end of per scale is to sentimenters and the reading observed for the last end is fourteen sentimenters therefore correct length of the boxes fourteen minus to equals to twelve sentimentrs while finding the measurement i should exactly be in front of the mark of the point from where the measurement is to be taken and it should also be parallel to the surface for example here we is the correct position of height for taking the correct measurement reading from position and see are not correct so right placement of scale and position of height or important to posits for correct measurement of lend,"['ar meter rod', 'other visible mark', 'measurement next step', 'correct measurement', 'end mark', 'appropriate divides', 'clock piece', 'suitable means', 'correct', 'end', 'mark', 'ar', 'rod', 'step', 'other', 'measurement', 'visible']"
Parts of the Plant, the plants are the only living organisms on earth that can prepare their own food they prepare their food by the process of photosynthesis all other organisms on earth depend on the plant and their products for the survival plant is mainly divided into root stem and leaves root is the underground part of the plant which grows vertically down in the soil root has root head which helps in the absorption of water and minerals they also help in holding the plant to the soil stem is the main access of the shoot system of plants it is green due to presence of clotofilpicg men it consists of nodes and internodes the nodes are the points in the stem from where the leaves arise stem helps in carrying water and minerals from roots to leaves they also help in carrying minerals from leaves to other parts of the plant leaf is the part of the plant where the formation of food takes place by the process of photosynthesis leaf consists of petiole and lamina ity all is the small stock by which the leaf is attacks to the stem plamonize the broad flat and then part consisting of wings and veinlets,"['plant leaf', 'clotofilpicg men', 'shoot system', 'main access', 'underground part', 'own food', 'root', 'other', 'leaf', 'plant', 'lamina', 'part', 'food']"
Characteristics of Living Beings, children let us learn what are the character states of living beings basically there are seven character states of living beings need for nutrition growth respiration sensitivity excretion reproduction and movement all living beings need food for their growth food gets energy to do any work all living beings growth ar baby grows into ar child and the child into an adult similarly seedlings grow into bigger plants and baby animals grow into adult animals all living beings respire breathing is apart of respiration in the process of respiration food and oxygen argues to generate and ergy some animals like dog ree through their nostrils like human beings plant green through the tiny powers on the surface of their leads called to matter do you know why are eyes grows in bright light and the plant to went to white some light actually whenever archange occurs in the around in of living beings they respond to at any change in the environment is cues stimulus all living beings are able to reproduce their own kind animals can either produce young ones are lay eggs all living beings exceed out the ways from their body living beings are able to move by themselves some animals move on the land some in the air and some in the water they move to keep themselves safe and to look for food plants are able to move there parts when they are growing but they do not change their position,"['beings growth ar', 'growth food', 'growth respiration', 'beings plant', 'beings respire', 'kind animals', 'respiration food', 'food plants', 'cues stimulus', 'bright light', 'tiny powers', 'character states', 'beings', 'animals', 'ar', 'food', 'respiration', 'excretion', 'plant', 'plants', 'light']"
Terrestrial Habitats, we all know that some places on earth of very hard some are very cold some have plenty of water and some have forest have you ever wondered how the organisms of such different habitat differ from each other organisms develop special adaptation to the area the leven the organisms those who live on land are call terrestrial ognisons and their habitat is non as terrestrial habitat there will habitat includes desert mountain region grassland and forest let us now about them in detail the set area is characterised by very low anal rain fold hit in picture hi when speed less humidity and very less availability of water despite of these extreme at we conditions you can see can setable amount of specialised plants and animals animals like camel snake rats and plants like chapters survive in these are conditions camel possesses long eyelashes that protect its is from the blowing sand and in ten sunlight its feet are wide and so that helped to work on sand without sinking into at its nostrils have special muscles that close the air passage of the nose during sand stone camel hump is eraser vi of fatty tissue and used as as sols of nourishment when food is cars rats and snakes stay in burrows to protect themselves from catching heat of desert they are active primarily at line thesert plant captus as modified its leaves into spines to reduce its surface area this adaptation has helped to minimise the loss of water during transpiration and attain moisture for longer duration its stem has take and ray coating that helps to retain water it also carries out the process of votosantesses as the leaves are reduced to spines let us understand this concept who an activity for beta and the standing bring upoted cacti plant and an leafy plant into aroom now tapolatin around the pateplants and place them in taretsan for an have then observe the amount of water connected on the pole thin bands well the amount of water collected in an leafy plant is much more as compete to acactaspland hence it is prove that catasloses minima water during transpiration and this adaptifeature makes it suitable to survive in desert conditions let us know about the nexteristril habitat the mountain region mountain region is cart arise by cold and win declimad in winter no volt axes place and gives in men duty to the area mountain trees are usually cone shaped and have sloping branches there leaves are needle like and help the rain water and snow to slide of easily plants on higher altitude are adapted to live on different mountain zones base the ponder adaptations mountain animals have take tin and fur to protect them from cold climate for instance arc snow leopard got etcetera heat possesses long hair which keep it warm snow depot possesses thick for on its body covering the feet and those which aids in working on the snow and protects it from in ten cold mountain got has hooved legs that help to plant the rough rocky mountain surface fall species of cold region are adapted for the survival the next terrestrial habitat is grassland it has grasses as the dominant vegetation rather than large shrubs or trees there are two types of animals found in the grasslands one of them is preditor and the other is prey predators are those that feed on other animals for example an tiger hainaetcetera while rays are those animals that are eaten by predators such as deer separate etcetera the adaptive features of is animals are as follows line has alihtbrounca led body which helps it to hide in the dry grasslands its is are in front of the faces so that it can locate its prey precisely it grapes its spray with strong jaws and laws deer has as strong set of teeth for chewing plant parts its sides are located on the side of the head so that it can look in all directions it has long years so that it can clearly here the movements of per it it also possesses long thin and strong legs to run at high speed while running away from the predator now let us learn about the next terrestrial habitat that is forest forest is a large uncultivated piece of land with dense population of trees shrubs and herbs it is characterised by high rainfall

Moving things around us, have you seen humming birds covering around the flowers and extracting nectar from them which among the bird and the flower is in motion you will see that bird keeps changing its position from one flower to other while flowers remain static at their original positions object which changes its position with respect to time is said to be in motion on the other hand objects which do not change their positions with respect to time are said to be at rest whenever an object is in motion it covers a certain distance in the particular direction in he specific time period now let us see around and see that which of the things are moving and which are at rest at your home objects like chair table are at the position of rest while the hands of the clock and blades of ceiling fan are in motion on the road you can see the traffic lights and glance are at rest while the wakers are in motion in this way all the things around us are either moving or at rest,"['hand objects', 'ceiling fan', 'chair table', 'particular direction', 'certain distance', 'time', 'positions', 'objects']"
Wind Energy Farms, the windmill used for generating electricity is called winter pine it converts kinetic energy of wind into electrical or mechanical energy the design of the blades of windmill is such that apressure differences created between them when wind strikes them this pressure difference produces a turning effect and makes the blades rotate about horizontal axes beads attached to shaft to rotate slowly which is not fast enough to generate electricity so a series of years is used to increase the rotation at this speed generator produces a lot of electricity the electricity produced by single windmill is still not enough for commercial purposes so a number of windmills are installed over a large area to produce large electricity such place is called wind energy farm,"['large electricity such', 'pressure difference', 'apressure differences', 'winter pine', 'energy', 'axes', 'large', 'such', 'electricity', 'windmill']"
Geothermal energy, geothermal energy is the thermal energy contained in the interior of the art the origin of geothermal energy takes place beneath the earth surface theep inside the earth co the auto co is made up of very hard molten rocks called magnet which envelops of solid in centre called the inner co surrounding the outer co is the mate it is made up of magma and rocks the outermost layer of the earth is the crust it forms the continents and the ocean floor it is about three to five miles thick under the ocean and fifteen to thirty five miles thick on the continent the earth crust is divided into several pieces called plates magma comes close to the earth surface near the edges of these plates these are the places where walkinozake deep inside the ar rocks and water absorbed heat from the magma temperature increases as we go down the earth let us now study about how ago thermal power plant words this heat inside the earth is hardness by due thermal power plants to produce electricity over thousands of the ears rain water sweeps through the cracks in the earth surface and collects in underground reservoir the magma heats the water until it becomes super heated fluid to reach this super heated fluid walls are dried five thousand to ten thousand feet below the surface of the earth these well are called production walls which bring the super heated fluid to the earth surface as this super heated fluid move towards the earth pressure decreases and some of this fluid starts converting into steam on reaching the earth surface this fluid moves through the surface five lines and into are well head separated inside the separated the pressure of the super heated fluid is reduced and high pressure steam is obtain this high pressure steam is then delivered to a large steam term the force and energy of the steam is used to spin the turbine lays the turbine turns the shaft which is directly connected to elec trical generator electricity is produced when magnets rotate within the generator the fluid which is not used is returned to the due thermal reservoir through injection well geothermal plants can operate round the clock and provide pollution free energy,"['heated fluid walls', 'thermal power plant', 'earth co', 'heated fluid', 'thermal power', 'thermal energy', 'pressure steam', 'earth pressure', 'thermal reservoir', 'earth surface', 'trical generator', 'magma temperature', 'molten rocks', 'free energy', 'fluid', 'ocean floor', 'outermost layer', 'co', 'steam', 'earth', 'pressure', 'rain', 'energy', 'generator', 'rocks', 'magma', 'walls', 'surface', 'reservoir', 'ocean', 'miles']"

Oscillatory Motion Vibratory Motion, oscillatory motion when an object moves to and fro about its mean position then motion is called oscillatory motion the bob of a pendulum goes to one end comes back to its mean position and then goes to the other extreme position this process is repeated many times the to and fro motion of a swing is also an example of oscillatory motion whibratory motion if the oscillatory motion is very fast and rapid it is called wibratory motion the tuning folk when strike against the rubber bad produces vibratory motion there are situations where some parts of the object move about its mean position repeatedly while others do not there is he difference between oscillation and vibration in an oscillation whole of the object moves to and fro along a definite path but in a vibration acertain part all parts of the object always remain fixed and do not move while the rest of the object moves to and fro in adefinite style both oscillatory and wibratory motions are examples of periodic motion,"['wibratory motion', 'motion', 'extreme position', 'oscillation whole', 'rubber bad', 'tuning folk', 'many times', 'acertain', 'object', 'position', 'wibratory', 'oscillation']"
Force, come children let us understand what is force our world is full of motion for example how we walk run pick up things drive or weakers et cetera motion less important to our lives and impacts so many things that we do all motion in the world happens because of force afors is abuse or pull the unit for measuring force is newton do you know it is the force that keeps the planets revolving around the sun in fact the snow flags falling on the ground and waves searching across the sea are also due to force you must have seen when two magnets come together then they either attract or repel depending on the position of the magnetic force the says because he the force that acts between them the bigger the force the more movement it can produce for can make things more have you ever kigdabol when you kicked you apply of for so it and ball starts moving for can stop the moving objects for example when we apply the breaks of our weakers are resist the force brings it to rest for can also change in objects shape for example when we crush an empty plastic bottle it gets deformed hence forces are acting everywhere in the universe at all times,"['things more', 'et cetera', 'magnetic force', 'force afors', 'objects shape', 'ball starts', 'snow flags', 'plastic', 'force', 'more', 'things', 'objects']"

Force Introduction, in our daily life we see numerous activities around us on the basis of that let us try to guess the answer based on our common experience do you know what makes an object at rest begin to move what causes an object to accelerate or desire and what makes an object to move in a circular part yes of course the answer is force it is the force which makes the object to move or which brings the object to rest from motion force and motion ar actually interrelated in this chapter we are going to understand the connection between force and motion fore you must have observed many of the times you go for shopping in he mark where you need he grocery card what do you do to move a grocery card simply you push it and when your shopping is complete you go to exit door now what you open it you pull its handle so to over grocery card or to open the door you apply yes fore hence we can say that force is he kind of push or pull on an object is force only a push or pull well we have to find out now do one thing place of football on the ground what will you do to bring it into motion you will kick it similarly to stop it you may place your foot on to it now we can say that kicking hitting pushing pulling all these terms can be replaced with he single term and you guess it right force,"['motion force', 'grocery card', 'circular part', 'common experience', 'numerous activities', 'daily life', 'motion', 'force']"
Magnetic Field and Field Lines, you must be aware of heating and chemical effects of electric current but does there exist more effects of electric current yes magnetic effect of electric currents well do you know that electric current carrying conductor behaves as he magnet well to prove this let us perform an agnivity with simple electric components make an electric circuit such that its two ends are free now take piece of take straight copper wire and place it between the two free ends of the circut place acompassneedle horizontally near this copper wire and now observe the position of needle of the magnetic compass close the geese to allow the flow of electric arentand the circet and now tell me what did you not us about the needle of the magnetic compass yes the needle shows the deflection what does the deflection and the needle in the cat exactly it indicates that electric or in through the copper wire has produce the magnetic effet hence we can say that electricity and magnetism are link to each other in eighteenth century many philosopher is sought to find the connection between electricity and magnetism in eighteen twenty hands cristion or famous sintis play an important role in understanding electromagnetism and now let as study about magnetic field and field lines you must be familiar with the fagthat compass needle shows deflection when brought near ar bar magnet in fact or compass needle is ar small bar magnet the ends of the compass needle points approximate towards north and south directions do you know that make bar magnet needle of magnetic compass also has two poles the end which points towards geographic north is called north seeking or north pole whereas the other end which points towards south is geographic south seeking or south pole the magnetic compass is useful for plotting magnetic field lines of ar bar magnet to understand this clearly let us perform an interesting agtivity take are white sheet of paper and fix it on ar drawing pole place the bar magnet at the centre of the sheet now sprinkle in fillings near the bar magnet gently tap the board what did you observe the in fillings alien sells in pattern well can you tell why in fillings arrange themselves in such patent what does the patent demand straight this is the region where and fillings experience the force exerted by the bar magnet so now it can be said that the regions the rounding the magnet in which the force of the magnet can be experience is called magnetic field but what about the mines along which the in fillings are magnhemselves these lines represent magnetic field lines but can these lines we open by some other method also yes of course to understand these let us perform one more activity fix he white sheet of paper on the wooden pot place the bar magnet at the centre of the sheet while the help of pencil draw the boundary of the bar magnet take the magnetic compass and place it near the north pole of the magnet can you guess how it will behave the south pole of the needle point towards the north pole of the magnet whereas the not fall of the compass needle is directed away from the north pole of the magnet but the positions of the end in and ess of the compass needle mapensil dots move the compass anti the end of the compass is over the second dot and bag the new position of the other with the third dot the process has to be repeated until reached the other pole and now join the series of dots this will give of field line of the magnetic field the same process is applied to plot other field lines on both sides of this magnet these lines are called magnetic field lines so far you have learnt how magnetic field lines are one but what about the direction of magnetic field lines micanmention the direction of magnetic field outsag the magnet is from north pole to the magnet towards the south pole of the magnet but inside the magnet the direction of magnetic field is from south pole to the north pole thus magnetic field lines are closed curves that take two points and b in the vicinity of the magnetic field looking at the magnetic field lines can you compare the strand of magnetic field at points and be it can be seen that the density of magnetic fee eld at point ais more than the density of magnetic field at point be so magnetic field at point a is stronger than the magnetic field at point be lets prove this take a magnet and place it at the point a due to magnetic force it will displace by some distance now take the same magnet and place it at point be again the magnet displaces due to magnetic force but this time the displacement the smaller than the previous case consider one more situation if we bring one more magnet in the vicinity of another magnet will the magnetic field lines intersect each other no two magnetic feed lines can never intersect each other this is because at the point of intersection the compass needle will point towards do directions showing two directions of magnetic field at a single point that is not possible,"['bar magnet needle', 'electric circuit such', 'compass needle mapensil', 'compass needle points', 'magnetic compass', 'magnetic field', 'more

Elastic Potential Energy, most of you have played with the rubber band gun do you know how it word it works by and verging elastic potential energy present in the stretch to rubber band into canetic energy when the rubber band is unstretched but what is elastic potential energy you are rd elastic potential energy is the energy stored in an elastic body when he force is applied to deform it but how dust the elastic potential energy stored in an elastic body you ride the ore done by the person while stretching the rubber band to load it on the gun is stored in the rubber band as elastic potential energy let us now study the case of elastic potential energy stored in he spring consider ar spring whose one end is attached to arigied wall and the other end is attached to ar block that as placed on he smooth horizontal surface when the spring is at its natal lend it does not the line for on the block this is the equilibrium position when the block is displays to the ride the spring tries to pull it back to the left and if the block is displaced to the left the spring tries to push it to the right when the block is displaced to either side and released it starts or solating the elastic body inherently wants to return to the equilibrium position thus after the spring is extend it or compressed it gains the abilergy to do work on the block attached to it this stability to do work is the elastic potential energy stored in the spring the elastic potential energy stored in aspring is given by the expression half ga ex squared where gate is the constant for the spring and egg is the extension or compression in the spring let us now lurk into some of the applications of elastic potential energy in mechanical devices like cars a spring is used to store elastic potential energy and functions as shark absorber when you openedish water door springs attached to the door store the gravitational potential energy of the weight of the door being lowered in the game of partially as well when the archer loads the arrow and oils the string the stretched spring stores energy in the form of elastic potential energy as soon aste archial releases the arrow elastic potential energy stored in the spring is used to shoot the arrow let us now summarise are learning in this animation,"['elastic potential energy', 'spring stores energy', 'potential energy', 'ar spring', 'elastic', 'shark absorber', 'mechanical devices', 'expression half', 'equilibrium position', 'natal lend', 'other end', 'energy', 'door', 'horizontal', 'band', 'ar', 'spring', 'archial', 'end']"

Revisiting Line Symmetry, we are familiar wih symmetry of figures here we will recall the understanding of line symmetry when we see certain figures with evenly balanced proportions we say they are symmetrical a figure is said to be symmetric if it can be divided into two identical halves the human face structure of ar butterflie plant leaves et cetera represent natural symmetrical patterns we are also where of the symmetric patterns such as in blodevils and ink string we also know that some symmetrical designs are formed by paper cutting and folding some symmetrical desine can be formed with geometrical tools the simple symmetry is line symmetry sometimes called reflection symmetry or mere symmetry it is easy to observe because one half of the object is the reflection of the other has afigure has a line symmetry if there is line about which the figure may be folded so that the two parts of the figure go inside a figure which is not symmetry is called a symmetry in the given figure the dotted line divides the figure into two equal paves so the given figure has linear symmetry a rectangle is symmetric about are horizontal line that divides it into two halves can you think of another line of symmetry in the rectangle if you are thinking of folding this rectangle about the vertical line that divides it into two halves then you are right this rectangle is also symmetrical about this vertical line thus we can say that arectangle has two lines of symmetry rhombus also has two lines of symmetry a square has four lines of symmetry letter is symmetric about avertical line that passes through its talk as shown here letter be is symmetric about an horizontal line that passes through the middle of the letter similarly you can explore symmetry in other letters and figures to this was a brief about the line symmetry lets have a quick re cap of our learning a figure has a line symmetry if there is a line about which the figure may be folded so that the two parts of the figure go inside a figure which is not symmetry is called a symmetry,"['line symmetry', 'wih symmetry', 'symmetry', 'symmetrical patterns', 'line', 'symmetrical', 'paper cutting', 'ink string', 'et cetera', 'identical halves', 'balanced proportions', 'certain figures', 'patterns', 're', 'butterflie', 'face', 'halves', 'geometrical', 'figures']"
Kinetic Energy, when we shoot an arrow from the bow we observe that it hits the target but if we throw the same arrow without using the bow then it is not bears the same target do you know why the distance travelled by the arrow in the two cases is different it is because the energy possessed by the arrow in the two cases is different in the first case the arrow possessed more speed and thus more energy so it covered modistance and was able to peers into the target while in the second case the speed of the arrow and thereby the energy of the arrow was less and so it could not travel sufficient distance to pierce the target the energy possessed by a body by virtue of its motion is known as the carnetic energy of the body the word canetic is derived from greekword caneticos which means to move ideally stationary body possesses no kinetic energy the as ar unit of carnetic energy is jewel the formula to calculate carnetic energy is half envysquare the amount of canetic energy of an object depends on the mass of the object em and its velocity we to demonstrate the dependency of mass on carnetic energy consider an empty tract with mass cm ban and the loaded truck with mass em to moving with the constant velocity we let both of them it into the brick wall mark at and be respectively impact on the walls is equal to the work done by the moving body the empty truck at the wall partially while the car true the polishes the wall completely the canetic energy of an object is directly proportional to its mass this means when masses double the carnetic energy is double for the same velocity similarly consider two cars with the same mass em it aware with different velocity we van and we to the slow moving car cats the wall while the fast moving car we the whole of the wall the caneic energy of an object is proportional to its velocity square it this means when velocity is double the carnetic energy becomes for time with the same mass caneticenrgy is possessed by all the moving object in the universe including ac crawling snail a shooting rocket and the rotating earth and so on,"['same velocity', 'canetic energy', 'more energy', 'same mass', 'mass cm', 'energy', 'velocity', 'same', 'masses double', 'car true', 'ar unit', 'stationary body', 'greekword caneticos', 'sufficient distance', 'mass', 'wall', 'empty', 'case', 'canetic', 'more', 'shooting', 'car', 'double', 'body', 'distance']"
Energy Conservation, energy conservation lets drop ball from a certain height and study about its energy at different points before it reaches the ground at point the ball has only potential energy when the ball reaches mid point be half of its potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy further at points the ball has only kinetic energy the entire potential energy of the ball at point got converted to kinetic energy of the ball at points thus we conclude the sum total of the potential and kinetic energy of an object also known as mechanical energy remains constant when the forces acting on it are conservative,"['potential energy', 'energy', 'different points', 'certain height', 'potential', 'points']"

Electric Current, the electric or electronic appliances that we use at our homes need an electric current to operate the electric current flows from the socicto the a plances by means of an electric wire to understand of an electric current is the is consider two charged objects at different electrictpotentials when both the charged objects are connected by means of ar conducting yr say of copper then the electric charges flow from the object at higher potential to the one at low potential till the both are care the sin potential this flow of electric charges in ar metal wire constitutes an electric current but what we know is that the electric charges whose flow in econducting wire constitutes an electric current are the negative charges called elec conc so let clear this doubt first long back when electricity was invented two types of electric charges were known positive charges and negative charges the electron had not been discovered at that time so electric current was considered to be aflow of positive charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current the conventional direction of electric current is from the positive terminal of as cell or ar battery to the negative terminal through the outer circui the actilflow of electrons is however from the negative trminal to the positive terminal of as cell or battery which is opposite to the direction of conventional current thus an electric crrent is aflow of negatively chargit electrons in ac conductor such as are metal wire but how des electric current flow in the wire lets know about it ar metal wire such as copper has plenty of free electrons in it when the metal wire is not connected to any source of electricity like as cell or ar battery then the electrons present in the wire move randomly between the atoms of the metal wire but when ar battery or cell is connected between the ends of the metal wire then an electric for acts on the electrons present in their due to this force the electrons which are negatively charged start moving from the negative end to the positive end of the wire the flow of electrons constitutes the electric current in the wire now the question is how to get ar continuous flow of electric current lets know about is as single cell has of potential difference of one point five volts which we nits to terminals the chemical process separates the positive and negative charges in as cell so that are concentration of positive chrges on the positive pull and are concentration of negative charges on the negative pole acre so when at dice is connected to at torch but through ar conducting wire then due to potential dlectrons of the cell it repels the electrons from the negative old which are atraptec by its positive pull this constitutes an electric current in the circuit due to which bulb clothes in order to maintain the electric current in the external circuit the cell has to ac pen the chemical energy which is stored in it the ball then the circuit glows until the entire conical towe inside the cell is used are the magnitude of electric current eye flowing through a conductor is the amount of electric charge to passing through are given point of the conductor in the seconds it is expressed as electric current eye equal to electric charge to divided by time tie the ear ene of electric charge is coulomb and that of time is second hence the encof electric current is foolompercecond which is called ambie when one coulomb of electric charge flows through any cross section of ar conductor in one second then electric current is seto the one ampere the smaller units of electric current are milliampia and myrampia but how do we measure electric current in an electric circuit at the ice called ammeter is used to measure electric current in ar circuit it is always connected in series with the circuit in which current is to be measured if we want to find out the electric current flowing through ar ball then the ammeter is connlected in series five the wall as the entire current passes through the ammeter so it has very low resistance so that etc may not change the value of current flowing in the circuit,"['electric current eye', 'electric current flow', 'electric current', 'ar metal wire such', 'electric charges flow', 'electric wire', 'ar metal wire', 'conventional current', 'electric circuit', 'entire current', 'electric charges', 'low potential', 'negative charges', 'current', 'negative pole', 'ar conductor', 'ar circuit', 'negative terminal', 'electric', 'positive charges', 'metal wire', 'positive terminal', 'potential', 'negative', 'conductor such', 'ar', 'wire', 'entire conical', 'positive', 'smaller units', 'cross section', 'ear ene', 'single cell', 'outer circui', 'elec conc', 'yr say', 'different electrictpotentials', 'electronic appliances', 'chemical', 'electrons', 'conductor', 'circuit', 'low', 'conventional', 'flow', 'cell']"
Equation, to impart the knowledge through activities or teacher gives eight identical pencils to each of four groups of students and asks them to pad these pencils and packets of their choice the first group made to packets containing three and five pencils the second group made to packets containing to in six pencils the third group made two packets having four pencils eats and the fourth group wet four packets wide two pencils in each packet mathematically these arrangements can be written as three lac five two plus sex four plus four and four multiplied by two do you see any relation among these expressions yes all these expressions are equal as the are different representations of the eight pencils so we can drives three plus five equals four plus for or three plus five equals two plus set or two plus six equals four multiplied by two or two plus sex equals four plus for these statements are equations an equation is amathematical statement of equality the mathematical statements given here contain equal sin so they are equations an equation has two parts one which is to the left of equal sin is called the left hand side or elechess and the other which is to the right of equal sin is called the right hand side or or chairs in an equation elite is always equal to the or aces thus an equation can be visualised like are we balance with equal weights on both sides if we put equal weights on the scales of ar balance then the scales are balance than vi of or sin for example in this balance the scales are balance that is the weight of the roots as two kilograms similarly both sides of an equation are balance or equal thus an equation is lack of balanced pair of scales have alerk at this balans on one scale we have three plus five and on the other scale we have two plus see here we have eight on both sides so we can say that the scale is balance thus we can ride it in the form of an equation as three plus five is equal to two plus six what if we change the sides of the balans in abalance changing the sides of the weights does not change the equality in the case the equation is to plausix is equal to three plus five here we have observed two facts about the equations the left hand side of an equation is always equal to the right hand side if left hand side and right hand side of an equation are inter chains then it does not affect the equality till now we have learnt about equations which contain numbers and mathematical operations only such equations are called numerical equations and the number is three five to and six are called constants are constant is as specific number or simple bat is assigned of fixed value for example one two three four five twelve seventy one etcetera are all pons tons now we are going to learn about algebraic equations for that we will introduce variables observe the wing balance with balanced scales can we represent the given information in the form of an equation let us try it on the right hand side there are then candies on the left hand side there are two candies and the packet of candies we are not aware about the number of candies in this packet in such situations where the value of commodities are known we represent the unknown by a letter of english alphabet let us represent the number of candies in this packet by the letter end now we can easily write the equation as end plus two is equal to ten were end represents the number of candies in the packet here end is awaryabl and this equation is an algebraic equation let us now formally to find very able and algebraic equations the letters which are used to represent are known antities or numbers are called very ables any letter of english alphabet can be used as were able for example be se be to are ex why set etc tra are alwariables why do we call them variables because the value of ar variable can vary it is not fixed an equation having one or more variables is called an algebraic equation can you identify the variables and constants in the following equations in the first equation ex is the variable five and thirty are constants in the second equation is the variable twenty and twelve are constants in the third equation we is the variable three and fifteen are constants is five vi greater than fifteen an equation no because there is no equal sign between left hand side and right hand side if the left hand side is not equal to the right hand side we do not get an equation its time to take ar quick re cap equation is the mathematical statement of equality the value of or constant is fixed the letter is used to represent unknowns are called variables the value of variable is not fixed the equations containing only numbers in mathematical operations are called numerical equations an equation having one or more variables sscalled an elgebrai equation,"['algebraic equation', 'only such equations', 'mathematical statement', 'equation', 'ar balance', 'algebraic equations', 'only numbers',

notes that petals are on was told in glass of ceramic antena can pickles be stored in containers made of metals like copper or aluminium now because the acid present in them reacts with copper or aluminium and produce substances which may have file pets on our held it shows that metals licoper and aluminium react with aids let us understand how other metals and non metals react with acids when aluminium turnings react with dilute hydrochloric acid aluminium chloride and hydrogen gas are found to understand the reaction of metals and non metals with acids mocleela let us perform an activity take hydrochloric acid and samples of metals like bits of megniciam ribon and zinc granules and non metals such as tapopouda and sulphapauda take fusingranuls in atetiue and at some hydrochloric acid and you will notice the bubbles of or gas appearing on the surface of zinc granules now bring ar burning candle near the mouth of the test you will clear apopsound coming out from the testo indicating the presents of hydrogen gas in the same way take bits of megniciam ribbon in at test and at some hydrochloric acid tied just like in the case of zinc granules the gas bubbles is to appearing on the surface of magnesium ribbon also the popsound confirms that the evolve gas is hydrogen now repeat the experiment with cacolpauda and sulphapauda surprisingly no bubles of agaswilbesin no reaction takes place on heating the contents of the testis so we can say that in general metals react with acids and produs hydrogen gas which burns with apopsound but non metals do not react with aces here the acid refers to hydroloric acid and sulphuric acid remember that copper dasnot react with dilute hydrochloric acid even on heating but it reacts with sulphuric acid metals like silver gold and platinum do not react with acids that is one of the reasons why they are use for making ornaments do metals and non metals react with bases also when sin granules and sodium hydrofsitsolucian ar heated bubbles of agasivond when aligtedcanda is prop near the mouth of the test it burns with popsound indicating the presents of hydrogen gas it means metals generally react with bases such as sodium hydroxide to produce salt and liberate hydrogen gas reactions of non metals with bases are quite complex it means that the product formed by such reactionls are not simple compounds for example when clorine reacts with sodium hydroxide sodium chlorate sodium low rid and water are obtain we can say that metals react with the variety of substances including acids salts water and oxygen is the reactivity of all the metals equal no some metals are more reactive and ate are more reactive metal displaces less reactive metal from its compound in at we solution this can be understood clearly with the help of an activity take for labelled beakers by se and de beaker and be contain fifty milliliters of copper sulphate solution as be case contains fifty milli litres of zinc sulphate solution while be car de contains fifty milli litres of iron sulphate solution now at sin granules in be car at iron nail in be car be and copper turnings in be case and did not is that the blue colour of the solution fades and about re red mass of copper gets deposited at the bar om of the beaker the colour of the solution be turns light green and a reddish brown layer is deposited on the iron name surprisingly the colour of the solution in be as and be remains the same let us interpret these observations in beaker the colour of the solution fades due to the formation of zinc sulphate which means that zinc is more reactive than copper and it displaces copper from the copper sulphate solution in beaker be the colour of the solution turns green due to the formation of iron sulphate which means that iron is more reactive than copper and it displaces copper from the copper sulphate solution in beaker and the colour of the solution remains the same which means that copper is less reactive than zinc and iron therefore no reaction takes place ar more reactive metal can displace ol less reactive metal from its salt but an less reactive metal cannot displace are more reactive metal from its salt such reactions are called as displacement reactions at the last let summarise what we have learnt so far,"['hydrochloric acid aluminium', 'acid metals', 'metals such',

Simple Epithelial Tissue, epithelium tissue covers the entire surface of the body on the base of number of layers the epithelium tissue is body classified into simple epithelium and compound epithelium simple eptelium has single layer of cells while compound epithelium as small tan one lear of cells on the basis of the structural modification of cells simple epithelium are further classified into five times squamous epithelium cuboidal epithelium columnar epithelium ciliated columnar epithelium and so do stratified epithelium squama epithelium tissue is composed of single layer of flatten cells resting on the basement membrane with the disc shape sent luteas and parcitoplasmo it is the simplest of the epithelia and allowed ethetion and futuration of substances across of squama epithelium squama epithelium is located and tipinner lining of blood vessels alveoli in lungs and bomans capsule in tile cuboidal epithelium is composed of single lair of cube shaped cells resting on the basement membran with large central new clears cuboidal epithelium facilitates secretion and absorption therefore it is commonly found in the ducts of glands tubular parts of nephrons and surface of ovary columnar epithelium is composed of as single layer of tall and slender cells resting on basement membrane with spherical nucleus and the base of it cell three surface of the columnar cells may have microvilli columnar epithelium held and secretion and absorption thus these tissues are found and inner lining of stomach and intestine the columnar an cuboidal epithelium if bar cilia on their free surface they are known as ciliated epithelium cilia are thread like proto plasma projections that help in the movement of particles or substance in as specific direction over the epithelium ciliated epithelium is located at the pine lining of the bronchiole and oviducts soda stratified epithelium comprises of single layer of columnar cells still it appears to laid due to different in sell hides and racement of the nuclei at different levels they are located in thiinner lining of urinary tract trachea and all factory mucosal this to do stratified epithelium secrete mucus and the cilia facilitate expulsion of foreign particles in outward direction the different likes of simple epithelium tissues as single layer of cells tastes not offer protection but act as secretry and absorptive offices,"['squamous epithelium cuboidal epithelium columnar epithelium', 'cells simple epithelium', 'stratified epithelium secrete', 'cuboidal epithelium facilitates', 'columnar epithelium', 'epithelium cilia', 'epithelium simple', 'simple epithelium', 'cuboidal epithelium', 'stratified epithelium', 'epithelium', 'columnar cells', 'central new', 'cilia facilitate', 'lining', 'factory mucosal', 'sell hides', 'spherical nucleus', 'disc shape', 'structural modification', 'small tan', 'cells', 'columnar', 'tract', 'different', 'direction', 'plasma', 'tubular', 'vessels', 'basement', 'single', 'surface', 'cilia', 'particles']"
Meristematic Tissues, when you open you sin text book and we have the sentences ration on each pads you observe that they are made up of words which are in ten made up of alfabeds here al for this as the basic units which combine to form words and words combine to form as send tells now can you recall the basic unit of the plant body absolutely correct it is the cell now think what is analogous to buds in the plant body well you are thinking in the ridirection it is the tissue let us quickly defined tissue is agrup of structurally similar or the similar cells that perform or common function now the question arises are plants and animals made up of the sencands of tissues to know the answer lets posomenotable differences between plants and animals animals can mouth and do not after tissues whereas plants cannot move here and there they possess supportive tissues composed of deccells which help them to stay upright animals require mode energy as compete plants as they have to room here in there insert of root companion and shelter in the case of animals growth and development is uniform on the other hand plants growth growth their lives pan to to the presence of special tissues at the these pick areas we call these miraculous tissues as meristematic tissues let us know about them in detail meristematic tissues have in mature and an the fenciatic cells that have the ability to divide actively that their lives these cells help to increase the lens and girth of the plants if you look at the structure of amestomatic cell you will find something very peculiar can you identify it well to find an answer let us compare with the structure of an normal plant cell here you can observe that is ratio of copies are huge pays however in amarstomatic cell the vacuole is either absent or extremely smaller in sides can you gas the reason behind this it is because the presence of or large vacuole causes an trends in cell division as it is full of cell sap to provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell depending on their location they are of three types of meristematic tissues present in plants namely apical meristem intercalary meristem and lateral meristem let us know about them in detail the price meristems are located at root apes and shoot apes the facilitate primary growth of plants that means increase the tent of root and stem of the plants now let us through light or intercalary meristem the intercalary meristems are located in the nos or at the base of the leaf petiole and that of branches these meristem cell in the growth of branches formation of leaves and flowers and the lateral meristems are present in the mature regions and along the lateral sides of the roots and the stele tells of this meristem divide only in radial direction hence are responsible for in trees in thickness of the plant and its parts cambium and cork cambium are the tides of latomeristelm let us can that as simple tivity to understand the plant growth in ar better way for this activity we require two anion balls two glasjars water and appear of sizes take two glasjas well both the gas with water and mark them as and day these the anion bulbs one on each jar now observe and measure the growth of roots in both the anion buds after three days on the fourth day at the root tips of the anion but in jar by by about an anti metal again observe the growth of rt in both the gas after few days and we call your observations we observed that in jar at any on but has long root as its root tip has not been cut off while in case of jar by truth do not grow of the cat in the rod tell do you know the reason behind it well this is because the root tip is the region of growth as it contains meristematic tissues hence in jar by the growth holds as the meristematic tissues have been cut off so we can can grow that meristematic tissues help in the growth and development of plant body so we have learnt that tissue is he group of structurally similar or the similar cells that performer common function meristematic tissue is the group of actively dividing cells on the basis of location it can be classified into three categories that are apical meristem intercalary meristem

Simple Permanent Tissues, can you recall the demarcating characteristic of the cells of mistomatic tissues well the cells of meristematic tissue keep on dividing so were would they be present that means meristematic tissues are present in growing regions of or plant now think about ad germinating plant thes it have only mstimatictissue at that time then how despermanent tissue permentuapicture to know an answer to this query let us understand what permanent tissues are and how are the formed when meristematic tissues divide continuously and reach the final stage of division they attain maturity after this point they lose the ability to divide and definciate to take up the permanent shape size and function such non dividing and specialise tissues are called permanent tissues permanent tissues are classified into two ties simple permanent tissues and complex permanent tissues as the name suggests simple permanent tissues are those which have as simple structure that means they are made up of as single type of cell similarly complex permanent tissues are those which have apomplex structure that means they are made up of multiple types of cells let us die deeper into simple permanent tissues simple permanent tissues are further placipie into treetipes that are he perencima be corencima and say sclerenima among these three types perencim is the most common its apiletissue as it fills the space between the other tissues if you look at its structure you will observe that it consists of relatively unspecialised living cells with thin cell walls which makes them soft it has densytoplasm small nucleus large vacuole and large intercellular spaces can you think of its location in aplant it is found in almost all the parts of aplant like leaves the pulp of fruits roots and stem and surprisingly its function varies depending upon its location when it is found in leaves it contains chloro plasso it definitely serves the function of pores in tassels here its modify name is corencima which is are makes of two words chloroplast and perencima in floating plants perencima has eatild intercellular spaces which gives buoyancy to them and helps them to float in water such parencimatissues are called erencima this term is again derived from two words are and perencima the secontype of simple permanent tissue is coroncima its responsible for providing texibility and mechanical suppoto the plant let us take an instance to understand the importance of this tissue have you observe that plants which stand heavy rain and fast blowing win what allows them to do so the presents of collencima in the of of leaves tendrils and stems of climbers provides flexibility and mechanical suppod if you look at its structure you will observe that it also consists of living cells but with tick ace walls as compared to the perencima if you take aclosalook you will observe that it cells are elongated and corners are irregularly ticcen they are by creating extremely little intercellular spaces the last type of simple permanent tissue is sclerencima if you look at the husk of coconat you will observe this type of tissue its responsible for providing protection an mechanical stem if you observe its structure you will find that it is composed of detcells which provides trend it is extremely thick wall due to the presence of lignin with no intercellular spaces this makes it hard and provides protistan can you guess where is found it is present around the vascular poda of stem veins of leaves at seta it also forms the hotshells of nuts and husk of cocona sleencima aces in various shapes but the two most common among them are fibers and series fibers are long and elongated while sclereids are irregular shape like sclerencima the epidermis is also protective in function now thing are they the same sclerencima is ar protective tissue made up of detcells while the epidermis is the outermost layer of flat cells being the outermost layer it covers the entire surface of the plant to protected sin it is protective in function should it possess intercellular spaces of course not and in order to minimise these intercellular spaces the epidermis has thick outer and side walls and thin inner walls epidermal cells serve were functions tepending upon the lotion epidermal cells of leaves secrete awake and water resistant coating which prevents the excessive loss of water mechanical injury and invasion by parasitic fungi do you know what are the special structures on the epidermis of leaves through which the loss of water occurs to know the answer lets view ar leaf under the microscope you will observe the specialised structures called stomata the bear kidney shaped cells called the guard cells when the guard cells lose water and become placed stomata close they are by preventing the excess loss of water in the form of water vapours this process is termed as transpiration epidermis can be thicker in those plants which need to minimise the rate of transpiration such plants are found in extremely dry habitats epidermal cells of roots bear hair like projections called root hairs they increase the surface area for the absoption of water and minerals but if you look at the stem of are young plant you will observe its outer layer its different from that of ar tray do you know the reason as the young plant methods its epidermis is replaced by astrip of the second re meristem when cells on the outer side are cut off from this layer they form the cork or the bark of the tree which is several leather cells of cork are dead and compactly arranged with no intercellular spaces the ovalts have ar chemical called suberin that makes them impermeable to gases and water now let recapitulate the

Ionic Compounds, table salt and sugar are two essential components of many food items which we consume the bolt or sodium chloride is an ionic compound while sugar is eco valent compound the compounds found by the sharing of electrons are called covalent compounds while th compounds formed by tons for of electrons are called ionic ll electrovalent compounds letter state about any compounds and their properties the compounds which are found as are result of the transfer of electrons from one atom of an elemen to the atom of another element are called ionic or electrovalent compounds formation of inicompouns and bolts the formation of cation and an iron the elements having one to or three electrons in their valansshell lose one or more electrons to form positively charged ion called cation for example sodium atom loses and electron to acquire as tepalelectronic configuration and forms sodium iron the elements having five sake or seven electrons in the valans shell of their atoms accept one or more electrons to form negatively charged ion called and iron for example thorinatem gains an electron and forms negatively charged chloride on the cation and anion being oppositely charged are held together tightly by the strong electrostatic force of attraction this force of attraction between cation and and iron is called and ionic bond the compounds formed from cations and and ions are called iron compounds the total charge on cations and and ions in an ni compound is equal therefore the are electrically neutral let us discuss the formation of sodium chloride the atomic number of sodium is eleven anthers electronic configuration is to eight on the atomic number of chlorine is seventeen and its electronic configuration is to eight and seven sodium loses the one valent electron and attains to the are to noble gas configuration on the other hand chlorine atom gains one electron and attains the nearest to noble gas configuration sodium atom transfers its one electron to chlorine atom to form as sodium iron and chloride iron after the donation of the electron from the sodium atom to the chlorine atom the ionic bound is formed between the sodium iron and chloride iron now we will discuss the formation of magnesium chloride the atomic number of megnatiomis twelve and its electronic configuration is to weight to the atomic number of chlorine as seventeen and its electronic configuration is to eight and seven magnesium atom transfers its to balance electrons to two chlorine atoms one each to form armagnatio iron and two chloride ions after the donation of the electrons from the magnationmatam to the chlorine atom the ionic bound is formed between the magnatioiron and chloride iron ionic compounds are different from the covalent compounds the are characterises be number of featres letter state bar them one by one ionic compounds have strong and rigid crystals the regular arrangement of ions in ionic compounds is responsible for their crystalline nature the afferent ionic compounds have different arrangement of ions therefore the shapes of the ectristolser or so different in an in crystal negative ions are arranged around to positeiron and positive ions are arranged around the negative ion he decreases the reposifors between similarly charged ions so we can say that two main factors which are responsible for particular crystal structure in an ionic compound are the size of the cation and anion and magnitude of the electrical charge on the ions ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points due to strong electrostatic forces of attraction between cations and and ions along amount of energy is retired to break these forces and their melting and boiling points are hide due to their high melting and boiling points the ionic compounds are solids at room temperature and non volatile in nature the melting and boiling points of some ionic compounds are shown here lets go to the laboratory and investigate what happens when the ionic compounds are heated for this we require an pulls of sodium chloride potassium iodide brim chloride are specula and bunsen burner the as small amount of sodium chloride in aspetula and heat directly on the flame of the burner repeat the same with potassium iodide and barium chloride note the colour of flame in each case and find out whether these sold melt or not you will observe that all the three salts do not melt on heating sodium chloride produces golden yellow flame potato mididetroduces are red valid flame and barium chloride produces an light green flame ionic compounds are hard and brittle they can be broken into pieces by lying force in general ironicompounds are soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvens for example potashum chloride is soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvens but why does it happen in water ions of ionic compound attract water molecules this we cans the electrostatic force of attraction present between ions as the result the ions are pulled from their fixed positions and the compound dissolves in water the organic solvents do not interactions so the do not dissolve ionic compounds in them now lets move to the next property of ionic compounds they conduct electricity in molten or in acquirsolution we know that substances conduct electricity only when they have free electrons are ions the ionic compounds can not conduct electricity in the solid state the cause their charges ions are tile packed for example sodium chloride as not conduct electricity in the solid state it conducts electricity when it is dissolved in water on dissolving in water the ions bracowa from their fixed positions and they are free to move and conduct electricity the ionic compounds are called electrolytes due to the electrical conductivity in the molten state and in acquissolution let us perform an experiment on test and it more clearly for this we require solutions of sodium chloride potassium iodide were am chloride carbon electrodes beaker cell ball press gy electrical wires et cetera assemble and electrolytic cell by using ab car and connect the carbon electrodes to the positive and negative terminal of the cell the the electrodes in ar sodium chloride solution repeat the same procedure with potash mid it solution and barium chloride solution did you see the bob glowing yes the bulb glows in all three solutions on dissolving sodium chloride potassium iodide in barium chloride in water free ions are formed these free ions are responsible for conducting electricity due to it the bulb glows in each solution this shows that the aqua solutions of ionic compounds have free ions so we can say ionic compounds are formed by trans for of electrons and consist of cations and and ions the are crystalline hard and brittle solids they have hi melting and boiling points the are soluble in water and conduct electricity in the molten and acquire

Mendeleevs periodic table, as of now we know about the existence of one hundred in eighteen elements most of them are found on the earth either in three state or in combined state in the form of minerals but the elements having atomic number greater than ninety to are man made till eighteen sixties only sixty three elements were discovered in order to understand the properties of these elements the sites of that time to to classify the elements on the bases of similarities in their properties the first successful classification of sixty three elements known at that time was given by the mid three mental he prepared the card for each element citing its simple along with some physical and chemical properties of that element then he arranged all the cards in increasing order of atomic masses while doing so he notice opatenand some of their properties for example he notice that as atomic mass increases the number of chemical bonds formed by that element also increases are to ascertain point and then edecreses again the patent repeats throughout mendelis or these repeated patents as periods he arranged these periods into groups of or columns the elements placed in the same roup and similar properties for example all the elements of group one are metals except hydrogen and form one chemical bond all the elements of group to are also metals but for to bones and this goes on while arranging cards like this so tan gaps appeared mendeli propose that the elements note discovered would fill these gaps and future features of original mental periodic table medals periodic table comprises of horizontal rows are matical columns whatical colents are called groups and horizontal columns are called periods groups the groups and mendeliperiodic table are numbered from one to aid group one to semen are subdivided into at and be sub groups but group at as no subgroups group as its sub divided into three rods each containing three elements all the elements place in apoticular group are chemically similar in nature and show regular gradation in their physical properties and chemical reactivities periods in mendelis periodic table the periods are numbered from one to twelve however the properties of elements in apoticalar period show regular gradation on moving from left to ride modified wersion of mental periodic table in the modified version the number of periods was degrees from twelve to seven while the number of groups remain same noble gases were places in the table as the separate group called the the or group without disturbing rests of the elements merits of medals periodic table medals periodic table was the first successful attempt that included all the elements known at that time the gaps left by mendeli in his periodic table body rated sites to discover new elements astonishing ly when the elements were discovered their properties were found to be similar as predicted by medals he proposed the properties of three elements named as eco silicon ecor elemenium and ecor boron which were later discovered at germanium gallium and scandium the properties of these elements were found to be much similar to mental lies predictions his periodic table grouped similarities and regular variations wortically horizontally in the properties of elements mendeli was so sure about his periodic law that he ignored the law of increasing atomic was assuming that the atomic wait by not be correct therefore he plays the elements were similar properties together for example cobalt atomic mass fifty at per nine appeared before nickel atomic mass fifty eight point seven the merits of mendeliperiodic ta ol positions of hysetopes could not be explained if one follows mendeli periodic law then the isotopes of same element should occupy different places for example the isotopes of hydrogen showed same chemical properties but according to mendeli periodic law they should occupy separate places in his periodic table but it was not done so the position of hydrogen was uncertain hydrogen resembles halogens of group seven as well as alkali metals of group one so its position in that periodic table remained uncertain chemically dissimilar elements were place and same group for example highly reactive alkali metals are places along with highly unreactive coinage metals in the same group chemically similar elements were placed at different positions for example copper mercury silver barium at cetera where scattered all over the periodic table despite having similarities in properties despite these problems mendeli contributions made the task of understanding the properties of elemens very easy for us to one his work the element with atomic number one hundred and one is named mendelivium the scientists acknowledged mendeliwerk by installing his statue and his periodic table on the giant wall in sent petersburg since some properties like atomic number were not understood at that time some radical

famous scientists al but in time who gave the theory of relativity nobellium after al fed nobel who invented dynamite and mendelivim after men delive let us study who was men tale and what was is contribution mendeli arissian scientist was are visionary who in eighteen sixty nine gave are far sighted version of the classification of elements the metre von of which men tale was born in tables in siberia on eight fevery eighteen therefore he completed his studies from university of saintpeters word at that time only sixty three elements who are known mendeli arrange them in the order of increasing atomic masses in the form of fatable and the table is known as mendelian periodic table in his periodic table he related the atomic masses of the elements with the physical and chemical properties is mean focus was on the oxides and hydrides formed by the elements but how did he reach to his periodic table mendelitook sixty three cards and rot altitales such as name of element atomic mass the non physical and chemical properties the formerly of its hydride and oxide on each card what next mendeli arranged the elements in the increasing order of the atomic masses in or exontalrose tell he encountered elelement having properties similar to the first element he place this element below the first element which started the second row of elements proceeding in this manner he arranged all the known elements of that time in the form of periodic table from this he notice that there is aperiodesity in the properties of elements on the basis of these similarities he proposed his periodic law the law states that when elements are arranged in the outer of their increasing atomic masses the elements with similar properties are repeated after regular intervals now here is mendeliperiodic table lets look carefully and find how it helps in understanding elements in systematic manner mendeliperiodic table has horizontal rows called periods which are numbered from one to seven it has at wortical columns called groups which are numbered from one to an group one to seven or for the sub divided into sub group and be based on the differences in their properties the elements place on the left hand side of this group constitute sub group while the elements on the right hand side of each group constitute subgroups group at has nine transition elements incresets of three elements notice there are some gaps in his periodic table he named these yet to be discovered elements using are sons prehree six ace which means first and also predicted their properties for example car boron acalumenium and acaselican take look at the position of vanadium and chromium in the periodic table have you notice something unusual from what he stated yes you got it right you elements of higher atomic mass are placed before lower atomic mass elements it means that he place few elements of higher atomic mass before an element having lower atomic mass in order to adjust elements having similar properties as we know many scientists have worked on the classification of elements than vi only men the leaves work is appreciate well this is so because he was able to classify all the then known elements and gave new direction for the research to the scientists lets identify some more merits of men deletes periodic table the properties of elements could be studied in agroup rather than the individuals so his classification was as systematic study of elements he left gaps at certain places in the period the table for the elements which were not this covered tell that time he for told the properties of these elements past on the aposition he designated these elements as acaboron ace elemenium and acacelican these elements were discovered years later and are now known as candium gallium and germanium respectively and the properties was similar to what mendeli predicted in out only predicted new elements he also corrected the atomic masses of some elements for example he corrected the atomic mass of beryllium from thirteen to nine similarly he also corrected the atomic masses of indium gold platinum at cetera medals vision was so clear that when noble gases were discovered they could be easily accommodated in his periodic table without disturbing the position of existing elements in spite of having so many advantages it had a number of disadvantages too let us go through them hydrogen exhibits the properties of both group one ea and groups even at but still it was placed in group one ad so the position of hydrogen was anomalous isotopes as we know are the atoms of same element having different atomic mass or atomic way therefore according to his law they should be placed in different groups but he did not provide separate places for the isotopes of an element for example hydrogen has three isotopes namely protium deuterium and tritium having one two and three atomic masses respectively which should be placed differently but it was not so mendeliplaced elements having higher atomic masses before elements that have lesser atomic mass in order to group the elements having similar physical and chemical properties this is contrary to his stated periodic law for example he placed argon having atomic mass thirty nine point nine before potassium having atomic mass thirty nine point one cobalt having atomic mass fifty eight point nine before nickel having atomic mass fifty eight point seven and tellurium having atomic mass one hundred and twenty seven point sets precedes iodine having atomic mass one hundred and twenty six point nine in order to place elements in the increasing order of their atomic masses he placed dissimilar elements together these elements have different physical and chemical properties for example the inactive coinage metals cope silver and gold were placed in group on by along with the most active metals like lithium sodium potassium at cetera of group one ad due to all these disadvantages many scientists of that time started searching for amorebasic and fundamental way for classifying elements this search was done for many years and finally led to the modern periodic table which is used till day,"['systematic manner mendeliperiodic table', 'element atomic', 'different atomic', 'new elements', 'atomic way', 'periodic table', 'elements', 'many

Modern Periodic Table, things change over time with every new day over world gets in rated with nutecnologes we miliobjects acquire new functions and unexpected atoms heavy papetexbooks have been replaced by electronic reading devices such as ereos which can be used anywhere any time the bulky cumbersome life jackets have evolved over the time into the functional comfortable and styles life jackets one such example of asertive refinement over the years was the creation of periodic table the first version of periodic table was constructed by the russian came the metre evonovich mendeli in eighteen sixty nine sixty pre elements were known at that time and they were arranged in horizontal rows in increasing order of their atomic masses the table simplified and systematied the study of elements but had several anomalies in nineteen thirteen henry mostly and english physicist found data atomic number was most significant for predicting the chemical behaviour of elements than atomic mass as had been previously that by mendeli so many leaves periodic law vas modified and atomic number was adopted as the basis of the modern periodic table in the modern periodic table elements are arranged in the increasing order of their atomic number instead of atomic mass this results omof the in consistencies with mendlyv periodic table for instance agent has create atomic mass than potassium but lower atomic number so the placement of elements in increasing order of atomic number resolved the issue of placement of some elements with higher atomic mass the for the von having lower atomic ms the modern periodic law given by henry mostly stated that the properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic number the table beads on modern periodic law is known as the modern periodic table or the long form of the periodic table as you read the periodic table from left to write you will notice elements being arranged in the increasing order of their atomic numbers the modern periodic table consists of eighteen vertical columns called groups or families these groups are numbered from one to at two groups on the left of the modern periodic table are the alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals on the far right are the noble gases are the inert gases the seven horizontal rows in the modern periodic table are called periods the first period of the modern periodic table is called as very short period it contains two elements hydrogen and herium the second and third periods of the modern periodic table are called as short periods they contain eight elements each the fourth and fifth periods consists of eighteen elements each and are called as long periods the sixth and seven periods consists of thirty two elements each and are called very long periods there are two series of fourteen elements each having similar tropoties placed in two rows at the bottom of the periodic table to avoid at becoming to lend these are known as the lantonites and the actinites now how do we decide the number of elements that can be present in aperiod this can be explained by determining the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the various shells of an atom to calculate this we use the phomiler two an square where in is the number of the given shell from the nucleos for example case can accomodate two electrons hence the first period has two elements elshell can accomodagte eight electrons hence the second period has eight elements em shell can accommodate eighteen electrons but the outermost shell in only has eight electrons so the third period also has eight elements the elements in agrouphave identical alter shell or valence shell electronic configuration for example if you look at the alkali metals present in group one of the periodic table the electronic configuration of lithium is to one sodium has electronic configuration of two eight one and that of potassium is two eight eight one all these elements contain the same number of valent electrons this is the reason why elements in ac group show similar chemical properties however the number of shells increases as we go domdicrope now let us consider the lectromic configuration of elements enaperiod let us take the example of elements of second period you can see that with the increasing atomic number the number of valent electrons also increases by von unit but the number of shells containing electr ons remains the same thus we can say that atoms of different elements with same number of shells occupied by electrons are placed in the same period to summarise at the end we can say that elements in the modern periodic table are arranged in the increasing order of their atomic numbers the eighteen vertical columns are called groups the groups in the modern periodic table signify an identical outer shell configuration elements within the group have many similar properties because of the same number of valence electrons the seven horizontal rows in the modern periodic table are called as periods elements are placed in periods based on the number of shells in their atoms elements fifty seven to seventy one and eighty nine to hundred and three fit into the periods six and seven these are called as land to nits and actynites respectively pl,"['shell configuration elements', 'periodic table elements', 'periods elements',

Periodic Trends in Modern Periodic Table, the periodic table is the most pawful tool or chemist has for organising the chemical in formation the properties of elements show are regular gradation across ar period are down the group in aperiodictable when we move across aperiod the number of shells remains the same but the number of electrons in the valence shell increases this is the reason while elements within aperiod show gradation both in their physical and chemical properties within agroup the elements have same number of valence electrons but the number of shells increases by one at each step and becomes equal to the number of the period therefore elements in of group show similar chemical properties but their physical properties show are regular gradation let us discuss how the various properties of elements such as valency atomic size metallic and non metallic character and the chemical reactivity change on moving agrof apperiod atom the group whalency is defined as the combining capacite of an atom with another same or de front atm electrons in an atom are arranged in definite shells the electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are called valence electrons and these electrons determine the valency of the atom the elements with completely filled outermost shell are stable for example helium and neon there helium has two electrons in its outermost shell and neon has eight electrons in its outermost shell the not combine with any other atoms thus they have zero combining capacity and therefore the valency of such elements is zero for atoms having less than four or four valence electrons the valency is equal to number of valence electrons for example magnesium has electronic configuration two eight two there are two electrons in its valent shell hence the valency of magnesium is to for the atoms with more than four valence electrons the valency is given by eight minus the number of valence electrons for example sulphur has electronic configuration two eight six it has six electrons in its outermost shell hence its valency is determent by subtracting six electrons from the octet which gives valency of sulphur equal to to on moving from left to right in aperiod the number of valence electrons increases consider the elements of second period on moving from left to right we see that the number of valence electrons increases from one to at therefore the valency of elements in aperiod increases from one to for and then decreases from for to zero in ar group the valency of all elements remain same consider the alkali metals of group von from lithium to froncium all the elements have one electron in their outermost shell which means the elements have one valence electron therefore the valency of all these elements is equal to one similarly in case of group two elements the number of valent electrons is to so the valency of elements of group to is equal to two now let us know how atomic size also known as atomic radius changes along the group and across the period atomic size of the atomic radius is the distance between the centre of the nucleus and the outermost shell of the atom as we move from top to bottom in ar group the atomic size increases let us take the example of group one elements as we move from hydrogen to francium the number of shells increases and hence the atomic size increases in aperiod the atomic size decreases from left to ride consider the elements of second period here lithium has the largest atomic size while flowing has the smallest atomic sizes this is because the number of electronic shells remain same but the magnitude of nucleic charge increases due to increase in atomic number nuclear charge is the positive charge on the nucleus of an atom which is equal to the number of protons in the new clears that is the atomic number and increase in nuclear charge decreases the size of the atom it is because the electrons are then ectracted towards the nucleus with greater force thereby bringing the outermost shell closer to the new clears hence the atomic size decreases it must be noted that inert gases like neon argon at setra are exceptions the atomic sizes are larger than the preceding elements due to the repulsion between the electrons of completely find shells now lets take an look at the arrangement of metals non metals and the metalloids in the periodic table the left and the middle of the periodic table is occupied by the metals on the right of the table are the non metals except for hydrogen which lies on the left of the table in between the metals and non metals are the metalloids they have the propertiese intermediate between those of metals and non metals the elements which have tendency to lose electrons and from positive ions are called metals or electropositive elements on moving from left to write in ap period the metallic character decreases in aperiod the number of valence electrons increases from left to right as the result the effective nuclear charge acting on valence electrons increases and hence the tendency of the element to lose electron decreases thus the metallic character decreases across apperiod on moving down the group the metallic character of the electropositive character increases this is due to increase in atomic size down the group the distance between the nucleus and outermost shell increases the force of attraction between nucleus and electrons decreases and less energy is required to lose the electrons thus metallic character increases in group one leathium is the least metallic element while transium is the most metallic elements similar order of increasing metallic character can be seen for the elements of group fourteen the elements which have tendency to gain electrons to from negative ions are called non metals are electronegative elements chlorine and oxygen are non metals they gain one and two electrons respectively in order to attain octet in their outermost shell on moving across aperiod the non metallic character increases that is the tendency to gain electrons increases this is due to an increase in nuclear charge and are decrease in the atomic sizes consider the elements of period tree where the non metallic character increases from sodiumnto argon non metallic character decreases down the group this is because the increase in atomic sites over was the increase in nuclear charge on moving from top to bottom in ar group consider the group fifteen elements the non metallic character decreases and the metallic character increases down the group the reactivity of metals increases with increase in metallic or electropositive character greater the electropositive character of an element greater would be its reactivity on the other hand the reactivity of non metals increases with increase in electronegative character thus greater the electronegatlic character of an element greater is its reactivity as we move along apperiectrm left to write the chemical reactivity of elements first decreases and then increases consider the elements of third period sodium can lose electrons easily as compared to magnesium and similarly magnesium can lose electrons more easily as compared to elemenium as the tendency to lose electrons decreases reactivity also decreases thus silicon is the least reactive element in the third period as we move from phosphorus to chlorine the tendncy to gain electrons increases hence reactivity again increases oxides of metals are basic and those of non metals are acidic therefore as we move from left to write across ap period the basic character of their oxides decreases while their acidic character increases for example in third period the acid base character of their oxides varies as follows al two or three is however amphoteric that is reacts with both acids and bases at last the variation in the propertease of elements in group and in ap period can be summarised as

of non metals tamond is extremely hard non metals are batcondactes of heat and electricity because they do not have free electrons in the dates except graphite rapid is an exception here as it is are good conductor of electricity and is often used in bat rays the non metals are non sonoras as they do not produce are ringing sound when struck hard non metals have low densities that is non metals are like substances except iodine and diamond then city of iodine is for point nine two grounds per cubic intimate which is higher than that of many metals tamandalso has hyd encity that is three point five to grounds per cubic intimate non metals have low melting points and boiling points except diamond and graphite no were an about the chemical properties of non metals such as their reaction with oxygen water dilute acids and hydrogen non metals react with oxygen to form non metallic oxides let us perform an experiment to understand it moclearly for this thick some powdered sulphur in an defegrating spoon and heated when sulphur starts burning introduce the deferating spoon in an gas jar cavait with the lead after some time remove the lead adusmonamount of water in to the gas jar and quickly close the lead shake the gas jar and check the solution with the blue and red litmus paper you will find that the blue litmus paper turns red while the red litmus paper remains an affected it is because sulphur reacts with oxygen to form sulphadioxide when the sulphadaoxide is dissolved in water sulphurous acid is formed sulphurous acid turns blue litmus paper red so we can say that the sulphadaoxide is acidic in nature the non metallic oxides are hide acidic or neutral in nature for example carbon darkide is an acidic oxide while carbon monoxide is are neutral oxide when carbon reacts with excess of oxygen carbon dark side is formed carbon dark dissolves in water to form carbonic acid carbonic acid turns blue litmus red thus carbon dark side is an acidic oxide if carbon reacts with limited of ly of oxygen carbon monoxide is formed carbon monoxide is no pets acid with water hence it is are neutral oxide non metals like white phosphorus is told in water as it reacts vigorously with are non metals do not react with water except halogens for example chlorine on dissolving in water gives hypochloras acid and hydrochloric acid in general non metals do not react with dilute acids but halogens like lorin bromine react with them for example when chlorine reacts with dilute hydro bromic acid hydrochloric acid and bromine are formed non metals react with hydrogen under certain conditions such as proper temperature pressure and catalyst etcetera for example nitrogen reacts with hydrogen at four hundred and fifty degree celsius and the high pressure and in the present of iron to form armoniagas similarly sulphur reacts with hydrogen at hytemperatur and forms hydrogen alpha gas al do non metals are less reactive as compete metals yet they are important to

Chemical Properties of Metals-I, we all are familiar with rusting of iron do you know what is rust and how it is formed iron reacts with oxygen and water waters present in the air to form rust rust is chemically and oxide of iron it is an example of are reaction of or metal with oxygen and it is at chemical property of metals generally metals are reactive in nature they lose electrons easily and form positively charged iroms that is why metals are called electropositive elements in techemical properties of metals we will learn about their reaction with oxygen water and acids etcetera almost all metals react with oxygen to form metal oxides but metals like cold and latin do not react with oxygen because we are noble metals let us perform an experiment to check the reactivity of different metals with oxygen the some metals such as sodium magnetium zinc and iron with the help of tongue cold the sample of each metal at the for of the flame of or burner notice sodium metal reacts with oxygen of air and form sodium oxide at room temperature it burns with are yellow flame magnetium metal reacts with oxygen and forms magnetium oxide on heating it catches fire and burns with adacling white flame sink metal reacts with oxygen on from heating and form zinc oxide it burns with or bright bluish flame iron metal has no burn in air even on strong heating so we can conclude that metals react with oxygen on heating in air and form metal oxides note that iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled in the flame of or burner sodium and potassium are very reactive metals therefore to prevent axyden bear kept in ceroseam some metal oxides are soluble in water they react with water to form alkali for example sodium oxide and megnitium oxide react with water to form sodium hydroxide and megnitium hydro side respectively let us find out how metals react with water most of the metals react with water to form metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas the in ten site of reaction of metal with water depends on its chemical reactivity some metals react with cold water some react with hot water some react only with steam whereas others do not react even with steam this can be on the stout clearly with the help of an experiment the examples of some metals like calcium aluminium iron and sin drop apes of each of the metal in separate metals filled with cold water you will notes that calcium reacts with cold water slowly and less vigorously the hydrogen gas thus released collects on the surface of the metal in the form of bubbles and the metal floats on water the metals like aluminium iron and zinc do not react with cold or hot water but they react with steam to form their oxides with the liberation of hydrogen gas so we can conclude that calcium reacts with cold water whereas metals licelumenium iron and zinc do not react with cold or hot water but they react with steam note that sodium and potassium metals react violently with cold water and liberate hydrogen gas the metals like silver gold and platinum do not react with water let us understand the how metals react with acids most of the metals react with acids to produce hydrogen as anterespective salts metals react with dilute hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid to give metal chlorides and metal cell fats respectively is the reactivity of all the metals equal no some metals are mol reactive than others when aluminium megnitium iron and zinc react with dilute sulphuric or hydro floricacit separately then corresponding sulphate of chloride salts of metals are formed with the liberation of hydrogen gas the reactivitieof dice metals can be indicated by the following sequens remember that cope thes noxreact with dilute hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid even on heating but it reacts with nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid do you know that nitric acid on reaction with active metals does not rides hydrogen as it is because of the strong oxidising nation of nitric acid metals react with dilute nitric acid and form various oxides of nitrogen according to the concentration of nitric acid and reactivity of the metal however very dilute nitric acid reacts with magneton and man ones to produce hydrogean gas metals like gold and platinum do not react with acids these metals only react with aquarasia aquarasia is the freshly prepared mixture of one part of concentrated nitric acid and three parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid it is are highly corrosive and fuming liquid it can dissolve all metals even noble metals such as gold and platinum so we can say that almost all metals react with oxygen water and acids therefore we can say that metals are reactive elements,"['flame magnetium metal reacts', 'flame iron metal', 'sodium metal reacts', 'acid metals', 'gas

Chemical properties of metals-II, metals are useful and important to us some of them are inert therefore the are used in making coins and jewellery but it is not mean the are and reactive in general the metals are reactive he react with the variety of substances including aphids opper and oxigon different metal reactivity with these substances for example so the ireactsreadily with opigion of air to form sodium oxide at room temperature iron gets rust it when exposed to moist air for a long time cold remains chemically an effective even after several years thus we can say that sodium is the most reactive and gold is the least reactive among these three metals so its clear thattiverent metals have ive front reactivity on the basis of their reactivity metals are arranged tin as series known as reactivity series of metals in the reactivity series metals are classified into highly reactive metals motheratly reactive metals and least reactive metals the highly reactive metals are placed at the top whereas the less reactive metals are last at the bottom are more reactive metal can displace are less reactive metal or its compound an actors solution for example if metal is place above metal be in the reactivity series it means metal is more reactive than metal be therefore meter lay can displace metal be from its fall solution to form salt solution of metal and metal be will be set free this can be understood clearly with the help of an activity for this we require copper wire iron name there is sulphate solution copper sulphate solution in to beakers take to label beakers and be filled with copper sulphate solution and very sulphate solution respectively now and iron name in beaker and copper wire in beaker be leave them for ate observe it the next day you will notice that the blue coloured solution of copper sulphate changes to light green and the reddish ran layer of copper is deposited on the iron nail surprisingly the colour of the solution in beaker be remains the same letters interpret these observations in ar be the blue colour of the copper sulphate solution changes to it green due to the formation of persulphate it means that iron is more reactive than copper and can displace copper from copper sulphate solution in beaker be the colour of the solution remains the same which means that copper is less reactive than iron therefore no reaction takes place so we can conclude that are more reactive metal can displace and less reactive metal from its salt but an less reactive metal can not displace or more reactive metal from its salt such types of reactions are called displacement reactions does it mean that an less reactive metal can not react with any non metal no it can react with non metals such as opposition clothing etcetera metals have one to or three electrons in their outermost shell and have at intensity to lose electrons to attain noble gas configuration on the other hand non metals have five face or seven electrons in their outermost shell and have at tendency to gain in it tones to get noble as configuration for example so the metal loses one electron from its outermost shell and form sodium at iron while the non metal chlorine acts at that one electron in its outermost shell to form floridean iron so the impetiron and chloride and iron combine to form sodium chloride but noble gases such as helium neon argon have completely filled outermost shell and therefore the denote part in the caecal reactions now letters summarise what we have learnt so far,"['sulphate solution copper sulphate solution', 'non metals such', 'copper sulphate solution', 'different metal reactivity', 'hand non metals', 'reactive metals', 'reactivity metals', 'reactive metal', 'sulphate solution', 'non metal', 'temperature iron', 'solution', 'metals', 'metal', 'iron', 'copper sulphate', 'noble gas', 'denote part', 'outermost shell', 'same letters', 'next day', 'label beakers', 'meter lay', 'several years', 'moist air', 'sodium', 'reactive', 'such', 'reactivity', 'neon', 'reactions', 'time', 'copper', 'clothing', 'blue', 'noble', 'letters', 'same', 'beakers', 'air']"
Chemical Properties of Acids, food shelter and clothing other basic needs of all of us due to continuous increase in human population the demand for food is also increasing to meet the increase in demand of food we need to increase the properties since the land available for pro production cannot be increase beyond the limit we must try to increase the sol fertility to meet the increasing demand of food when of the methods of doing so is by adding votelizes such as urea ammonium nitrate potash on for fate at seta to the soil amonia nitrate is an important portal acid which is used to replenish nitrogen in the soil it is prepared by the reaction of ammonia we nitric acid hydrochloric acid sulphuric acid and nitric acid in organic acids having similar chemical properties chemical properties of acids include the reaction with water metals metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates metal oxides and basis lets now about them in detail one by one acids on reaction where water form age plus or hydronium ions due to the formation of these ions at was solutions of acids exhibit to distinctive properties that is they turn blue litmus red and they conduct electricity remember acids do not dissociate in gaseous state that is the reason when at drive blue litmus paper is dipped in jar filled with dry sea gas the colour of blue litmus paper does not change but when ar moist blue litmus paper is tip in the same jar the colour of the blue litmus paper changes to red because now it will furnish edge plus ions let us take some compounds having hydrogen in them such as hydrochloric acid sulphuric acid glucose and can all and find whether they conduct electricity or not see hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid dissociate completely in water to produce age plus or hydronium ions and thus conduct electricity while glucose and it and all does not conduct electricity as they do not dissociate completely in water so we can say it is not necessary that all the compounds containing hydrogen are good conductors of electricity now we will find what happens when metals react with acids so the hydrogen gas are formed by the reaction of acids with metals but how can one be so core that the gas evolved in the reaction is hydrogen hydrogen is or colourless gas and its presents can be can formed with the help of or burning candle lets go to the laboratory and see how it can be done the some zinc granules an aces tube and add some dilute sulphuric acid to it notes the evolution of gas bubbles on the surface of the zinc granules pass this gas through the soap solution bubbles of gas can be seen in the soap solution when ar burning candle is brought to near to evolve gas apopsound is hard which indicates the piles of hydrogen gas similarly hydrochloric acid nitric acid and acetic acid also react with sing to form the corresponding is in salt and hydrogen gas apart from water and metals acids also react when metal carbonates and hydrogen carbonates as salt carbon dioxide and water are formed by the reaction of acids with metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates now we will go to the liboritry and perform an activity to know more about it the exsmall amount of sodium carbonate in aces tube and add small amount of dilute hydrochloric acid to it observe the bubbles of or colourless anode less gas when these bubbles of gas are passed in test tube containing lime water it turns milky due to formation of calcium carbonate it indicates that the gas evolved in the reaction is carbon dioxide when excess of carbon dioxide is passed in lime water calcium hydrogen carbonate is formed which is soluble in water and therefore the milk in as disappears when hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hydrogen carbonate the evolution of same gas acids carbon dioxide is observed acids react with metal oxides also the products of th is reaction are salt and water lets perform an activity to understand how it can be done dake small amount of copper oxide in a beaker now add hydrochloric acid to it with continuous stirring did you notice any change yes the colour of the solution has changed to blue green indicating the formation of copper to chloride another class of compounds with which acids reactors basis salt and water are the products of this reaction this reaction is called neutralisation reaction reaction of phosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide to form sodium force fade and water is an example of neutralisation reaction it would be interesting to know that metallic oxides can also be referred as basic oxides because they

Breathing in Water, do you know how fishes breathe only in water and not in air most aquatic animals need to obtain oxygen from the surrounding water in order to carry on cellular respiration fishes have gills an important respiratory organ which is activated in water outside of water fishes cant breed because they do not have breathing organs like humans in fishes gills help them to use oxygen dissolved in water water contains dissolved enough oxygen to support life gills are specialised structures in which the blood comes into contact with the water over the very large surface area just like in the lungs then carbon dioxide is expelled through the same surface so in fishes these gills are well supplied with blood vessels for exchange of gases,"['fishes gills', 'respiration fishes', 'enough oxygen', 'aquatic animals', 'surface', 'fishes', 'respiratory', 'gills', 'specialised', 'oxygen']"

Central Nervous System in man, nervous system comprises of three main parts central nervous system peripheral nervous system hence autonomic nervous system out of these three systems central nervous system is an important system central nervous system consists of most important organs of the body which are brain and spinal cord the brain is an loss in the scale and the spinal cord is located within the wortebral colum the brain the spinal cord and the nerves will com cordination with each other the nerve self bread all over the body they do the work of receiving stimulus from the body as the as surroundings and transmitting the signals to the brain and spinal cord the centformation in the form of stimulus is sent to the brain which then processes the information palte processing the information responses generated and thus bdhe acts accodingly the brain is the decision maker and edcontrols major activities of the body during the process of decision making brain absorbs only relevant information and discorde the rest the outer surface of brain is folded and has reges in proves the brain has three main parts cerebram cerebellum medalah oblongata the each part of the brain is responsible for different functions in he body cerebram is the largest portion of the brain and is divided into right hemisphere and left hemisphere cerebram controls all the voluntary activities of the body for instance plain writing in climbing the cerebellum located under the cerebram its main function is to balance the body and cordinat the muscular activities the cerebellum receivnes information from the sensory systems the spinal cord and other parts of the brain and end regulates motor movements hence cerebellum controls the involuntary activities of the body the next part is medalah oblongata which is the lowest part of the brain and continues up to the spinal cord its function is to control the activities of all the internal organs in abody like heart beating respiratory movements peristalsis of alimentary canal at ceter hence injury to this part may lead to death of the burstem spinal cord extends from the medalah oblongata of the brain till the whole length of the backbone spinal cord controls the reflexes below the neck conducts messages from the skin and muscles to the brain and also conducts command from the brain to muscles of the train limbs hence the central nervous system is the central information processing centre and acts as the command and control system,"['main parts central nervous system', 'system central nervous system', 'main parts cerebram cerebellum medalah', 'central nervous system', 'central information processing', 'nervous system', 'hemisphere cerebram', 'information', 'system', 'activities', 'cerebram', 'whole length', 'alimentary canal', 'largest portion', 'different functions', 'outer surface', 'decision maker', 'wortebral colum', 'movements', 'spinal', 'parts', 'plain', 'part', 'self', 'cerebellum', 'organs', 'medalah', 'hemisphere', 'processing', 'main', 'decision']"
Food chain, the green plants form the first trophic level as they prepare their own food they are producers here the insects form the second trophic level as they eat or consume the green plants they are primary consumers frogs form the third trophic level as they depend on insects for their food they are second re consumers snake eats the frogs and hence forms the top trophic level it is tertiary consumer this shows that as we proceed from lower trophic level to the higher one the amount of energy decreases due to some loss of energy at each trophic level,"['trophic', 'own food', 'green plants', 'consumers', 'tertiary', 'food']"
Food web, all the living organisms obtain and ergy from food for their survival food is prepared by the green plants also called producers by the process of food or sin as as whereas consumers depend directly or indirectly on producers for their food this dependence of one organism on the other for food is depicted by of food chain ar food chain depicts the sequens of steps through which they you need directional floor of energy occurs in an ecosystem there might be condition when one organism of of food chain may become apart of another food chain for example green plants can also be consumed by other primary consumers like square and sea pre similarly a rabbit can also be consumed by a fox alion may also get other feeding options like as brass and afox this depicts that for food chains are interconnected to each other in the first food chain green plants are eaten up by azebrer and then the sea prize eaten up by lion in the second food chain green plants are eaten up by a rabbit and the rabbit is consumed by a lion in the cord food chain green plants are eaten up by rabbit the rabbit is eaten up by a fox and then the fox is consumed by lion in the food food chain green plants are eaten up by squirrel which is consumed by a fox and lastly the fox is consumed by lion such complex feeding relationships form of food web so ar food web is formed when several food chains are interconnected similar too food chain the base of the food web is occupied by the producers which are green plants unlike food chain ar food web provides and alternate food source for each organism which in shores better chances of survival of organisms in case one of the food sources becomes cars,"['food food chain green', 'food chain green', 'food chain', 'such complex feeding relationships', 'food', 'other feeding', 'shores better', 'other primary', 'sea prize', 'fox alion', 'directional floor', 'green', 'other', 'fox', 'sea']"
"Endocrine glands: Hypothalamus, Pituitary, Pineal", your head is one of the most important parts of your body not just because it contains the brain but also because it contains some of the vital glands of the endocrine system can you name these glands well they are hypothalamus pituitary and pineal let start with the hypothalamas the word hypothalamus is derived from two greekvords that means under thalamas yes this is exactly where the hypothalamus is located in the brain beneath the thalamus and above the pituitary gland it tells the pituitary gland von to start or van to stop making hormones though hypothalamus is almansites it plays an important role in maintaining whom you stay sends in order to maintain whom you aces it acts as connecte between the endocrine and the nervous system it plays an essential role in maintaining body temperature thirst appetite emotions et cetera now let us talk about the gland which is located just below the hypothalamus it is the pituitary gland although this land is not bigger than ape it is considered as the most important gland it is the mass der and to grind gland of the body but do you know the reason you get it ride as the mastercontrols the class this gland controls the function of all the other endocrine glands it uses information received from the hypothalamus to tell other glands in the body to either start as top secreting hormones now let us talk about the gland which is located in the middle of the brain in between the two hemispheres but before knowing that can you answer this question why are ii lets start to fly heavy in by evening and open up in the morning automatically at approximately the same time as for or fixed rotine have you wondered how does this happened its because of the tiny pineal gland that regulates or sleep wake cycle you can see this gland is small retired pine cone shaped instruction the pineal gland contains pinelow sites which secrete melatonin hormone the hormone melatonin regulates the sleep wake cycle all the glands present in our head are important for maintaining several complete by logical mechanisms of our body and problem in any of the lane affects the overall functioning of the body,"['temperature thirst appetite emotions et', 'important gland', 'endocrine glands', 'pineal gland', 'pituitary gland', 'important role', 'endocrine system', 'hypothalamus pituitary', 'gland', 'hormone melatonin', 'melatonin hormone', 'pinelow sites', 'pine cone', 'same time', 'mass der', 'glands', 'important', 'endocrine', 'hypothalamus', 'role', 'pineal', 'system']"
Analogous Organs, these on embryonic origin and basic structure organs can be classified into two types homologous organs and analogous organs organs which do not have common origin but performed similar functions are known as analogous organs carefully observe the wings of birds bats and insects we all know that they are used for life however anatomical structure of each is different in birds for limbs are modified into wings made of feathers these wings exert are downward foes that helps the birds to lift up wings of that are folds of skin between bones of elongated fingers these have originated from forelimbs and membranous skin of the abdomen wings of insects are extensions of the cutaneous exoskeleton these are originated from the inner and outer surface of their body similarly the flippers of penguins and tall fins are originally different but both use the flippers to swim under water the study of analogous organs suggests that distantly related or totally unrelated animals developed similar organs or adapted features due to their similar habitats this is called convergent evolution thus during the course of evolution analogous organs developed in animals belonging to different lineages,"['analogous organs organs', 'evolution analogous organs', 'similar organs', 'structure organs', 'homologous organs', 'analogous organs', 'membranous skin', 'elongated fingers', 'downward foes', 'birds bats', 'structure', 'similar', 'origin', 'evolution', 'skin', 'birds', 'different', 'wings']"
Monohybrid cross, it is often said that we resemble appearance do you know how this mirical happen well it is because we inherit the characters or traits from appearance this process is called heredity the question is at the parental characters or transmitted well the here tetra in formation is present in the games these gametes fuse to get the during the process of sexual reproduction and the genes are transmitted from parents to the offspring gene exist in the vent fans or alles in an organism one allele for ive ge is inherited from each per thus we can say that for each trait the awe be two versions in the offspring now you might be wondering that which version is expressed in the offspring well each trait can be influenced by both paternal and maternal elemen as both the father and the mother contribute equal amounts of genetic material to the child however the mechanism of transfer of characters from one generation to the next was not non anti be early nineteenth century so how do we know this well this study stand by the sinters greater ohanmented intended century the word or nearly ten cousin to plants of thertyfor different varies before the standing the ments it periments let us now on terminology that help us is py the crosses performed by him during his experiments he gene hens has two manifestations one the combination of it scales to the character it expresses the description of genes present in an organism is referred to as its genotype it is represented by appear of letters for example if or plant is to its genotype can be the capital ti capital tall or capital the small tan here tallness of or plant is the rise cal or external characteristic of an organism which is observable this is refer to as its phenotype always remember that an organism genotype cannot be in for by simply observing its pinoti now again observe the to defend genotypes of single phenotypic trait that is tones the genotites can be capital ti capital ti or capital tismaltel in the former case you can observe that to the letters or say that is capital the capital ti this depicts that the oganesson is homozikes where homomean sin in the latter case we can observe that one letter is capital day while other is mate this depicts that the organism is hero sites where heteromeans the from now you might think that if or plant has an ly capital try and small ti both will be at to land or dwarf plant well the all which is represented by ar capital letter is the dominant and for example tallness is represented by the capital ti adominent alle is the on which is able to express it sells it decides the appearance of an organism so the allele representing capital ties mate will be tall as capital ti is dominant over small ti here mate represents the dwarf ness the allele which is represented by or small let is the recessive on the sessive all does not express itself in presence of dominant allele some of the dominant traits observed in humans are black and curly here the attached earlobes etcetera and recessive traits are brown and straight here attached earlobes etcetera just like humans plants also have dominant and recessive traits mental studies seven pairs of contrasting characters or traits in tip lands these characters are refer to as pars because they seem to be the two variations of as single character out of which one is dominant and other is recessive for example plant hit which can be tall or dwarf position of the flower can be terminal or axillary the shape of the pot can be conspected or inflate the colour of the put can be yellow or green the shape of the set can be renal or wrong flavor kale which could be purple or white similarly we can study seed chala which can be green or yellow by taking we can froting characters mental per fan several crosses one of the most an potent crosses as monohybrid cross so others are monohybrid cross well mono means one and hybrid means met of to so monohybrid cross is the cross between two individuals involving as single contrasting trait for the monohybrid cross mental considered single chapter at that is plant high when mental cross bio bred to plant with the pure bred dwarf plant we got all the tall plants in the on generation of first filial generation the offspring of tin by this cross were called von progeny here we can see that all the plants are hetrosigustl which is represented by capital small ti so we can infer that ll of them have the same genotype this means that only one of the parental traits was expressed that is tallness now his self polonated the von progeny this can be shown by panic square pan it square is an extreme lim potent and useful method to explicate across upon at square is the graphical representation of the possible genotypes of an offspring arising from or particular cross when he cross pollinated the on progeny the following result was obtained can you find the phenotypic and genotypic ratios here we can clearly see that they are three tall plants and one dwarf plan so the phenotypic ratio is free to an among the three dominant phenotypes to our hetrosigastal while the remaining one is homozygotall that is two dominant ons have the genotype off capital ti small ti while the remaining one has capital ti capital ti this breaks the genotypic ratio into one capital ti capital ti is to two capital try small ti is to on small ti small ti or simply ones to to is to one in shall after conducting this cross mental concluded that traits that were absent in first filial generation at re appeared in the second filial generation the calls as suppress traits as recessive traits and express traits as dominant traits he also concluded that some factors are inherited by offspring from the appearan over successive generations these factors were termed as genes later by danishbotnest will helmguhansen none us understand of mental concluded about first filial and second filial generations in first filial generation all the plants were tall but they differ from the tall plants of the second filial generation do you know how well if you look at the genotype of to generations you will see the difference in first filial generation the plants also contain the genes for dwarf ness however the dominant trait was dominant over the dwarf ness the character that expressed in evongenration was found to dominate the other contrasting character whenever they were present together in ar genetic locus to express itself recessive allele had to be homosgues which was clearly not the case in van this gives the law of dominance which states that when two different alleles are present together in a diploid cell the dominant one gets expressed and the recessive one gets mass and only the dominant character will be expressed in the second filial generation both tall and dwarf plants were present however we no typically the over two types of plants that are tall and dwarf but genotiplically they over three types of plants comprising of genotype capital ti capital ti smaltysmalty and capital tie multi so now we have understood the monohybrid cross but do you know the significance of these crosses these crosses are low scientists to determine the dominance of traits they also help scientists realuate how heterozygos of strength express the genes they

Integers - Negative and Positive Numbers, so pea goes to as show she purchases ten chocoletes from the shopkeeper for her friends the cost of ten chocoletes is one hundred rupees but so pea has only ninety rupees with her she re quest the shopkeeper that she vi give ten rupees the day of to tomorrow the shopkeeper right ten rupees as the diamond from her in his tyres so ea gives tenchocoletes to her friends now how many chocoletes are left with so pea it is given by total number of choplets minus the chocoletes given that is ten minors ten it is obvious that she has no crocoletes with hr can we say that she has zero chooletes with her yes she indeed has zero chocoletes with her you know that the shopkeeper rod ten rupees as the diamond from so pea but how would he remember where the ten rupees has to be given or has to be taken from so pea he can remember all his trans actions by writing them in different ways like either writing them with tiviont colers called with different signs he chooses to write the de amount from so pea with ar negative sign this is an number with ar negative sign can you find any of the situation where we use numbers with a negative sign yes in ar day to day lie we see that some numbers carry an negative sign for instance in business profit is denoted by positive sign and loss is denoted by the negative sign the temperature above zero degree is denoted by the positive sign and the temperature below the zero degree is denoted by the negative sign the numbers with which a negative sign is attached are called negative numbers in ancient times different attempts or made in order to study these negative numbers in two hundred bc the chinese used the rod numerous is temp to represent positive numbers and negative numbers the over two types of rod numbers the hangs from one to nine and the zones ranging from ten to ninety the numbers were represented by combining these two tips of rods the used red rods to represent positive numbers and black rods to represent negative numbers in six hundred and twenty sa the indian mathematician number bother called the positive numbers as fortunes and negative numbers as tens at that time in dia had aplical system and concept of zero he give the first rules for dealing with zero as the number in the early eighteenth century don value was the first the rope in mathematician to give information about negative numbers he represented negative numbers and positive numbers with directions the steps to the right of zero is represented by polar sign and to the left of zero is represented by negative sign these numbers with negative sign are less than zero which further implies that the negative numbers are less than the positive numbers as some zero as the starting point on the number line if an object is placed at two on the number line it means the object is two steps away to words right from the starting pin and if an object is placed at negative five on the number line it means the object is five steps away to words left from the starting pin in other words if we move one step to words right from ar given number we get the successor of the number similarly if we move one step to words left from ar given number we get the predecessor of the number to we in for the cone steps of successor and predecessor let solvenexnumber we will first right to find the successor and

Addition of Integers, addition ofsinteages three trends patrick gate and chris decade to play ar game the have taken an numbers trip marked with integers from negative ten to positive ten and well cards marked with integers from negative six to positive six let us look at the games instructions there will be only two runs players have to put their different coloured counters at zero position to start the game whenever ar player gets of platin card he or she has to move towards the right direction from zero that is towards positive ten and if ar player gets a minor sign card then he or she has to move towards left direction from zero that is towards negative ten if ar players counter touches negative ten or less than negative ten then layer is out of the game or if players counter touches positive ten or more than positive ten then player wins the game let start the round one first is patricks turn he shffles the cards he gets positive five now ewill move his counter to positive five towards the right direction from zero next s gates turn she shuffles the cards and gets positive one she will move her counter to positive on towards the right direction from zro next is cristae turn he shuffles the cards and gets negative three he will move his counter to negative three towards left direction from zero let us check the standing of players after round one patrick is leading the game by positive five gate is on second position with positive ne whereas criss is at third position with negative three let us continue the game and start the second run first is patrick turn he shuffle the cards he gets negative on adding negative on to positive five gives positive for that means he has to move his counter to positive for next is gates turn she shuffles the cards and gets positive five adding positive five to positive von gives positive six which means she will move her counter to positive six next is chrisis turn he shuffles the cards and gets positive sa adding positive six to negative three gives positive three that means he will move his counter to positive three let us check the final standings of the players patrick kite and chris countyers are on positive fall positive six and positive three respectively on the numbers trip thus gate is winter patrick is on second position and criss is on tied position so,"['ar players', 'positive', 'patrick turn', 'second position', 'sign card', 'players patrick', 'games instructions', 'well cards', 'numbers trip', 'ar', 'direction', 'coloured', 'chris', 'second', 'turn', 'card', 'position', 'patrick', 'players', 'final', 'cards']"
Summary of Integers, let us recall what we have converted so far in the module and in teacher is the number that has no fractional part and note its after the tesmal point and in teacher can be positive negative or zero the set of all in teachers is often shown like this in teachers are useful in telling temperature rise or fall altitudes above se level are depth below see level and different measure ments we represent in teachers on an number line like this an number line shows positive numbers towards the like of edo and the negative numbers to rd the left of zero zero is an in teacher but is neither positive or negative and in positive in teachers is just like simple addition for example positive for plus positive seven equals to positive eleven subtracting positive in teachers is just like a simple subtraction for example positive seven minus positive for equals to positive three subtracting negative in teacher from positive in teacher is same as adding for example positive six minus negative for equals to positive ten adding the negative in teacher to positive in teacher is same as subtraction for example negative seven plus positive three equals to negative for,"['positive negative', 'tesmal point', 'fractional part', 'simple', 'measure', 'negative', 'positive', 'number', 'teacher']"
Subtraction of Integers, new york is the state on the north eastern five of the united states of america the states most popular city new york seta has an average minimum temperature of positive two degree celsius in the month of abruarie do you know there is another state whitives much colder than new york the state of alaska is on the north five side of the united states of america the were bank city of alaska has an average minimum temperature of minus three degatisel sees in the month of abruary can youtil the tivefrence between these two temperatures here the numbers positive to an negative three represents integers so in order to find thetemptrative ive trans we must know how to subtract integers can you device ar netive for subtraction of integers asitan in case of the addition of integers we have already learn how we can add integers on the number line for instance stake the sum positive five plus positive three to find this we start from the number positive five on the number line and then move three steps to the right side this way we end up at positive thus the sum positive five plus positive three equals positive ad we also learnt how we can add ar positive integer and a negative integer for instance take the sum positive five plus negative three to find this we start from the number positive five on the number line and then move three steps to the live side this way we end up at positive to thus the sum positive five plus negative three equals positive to observe the two cases it can be noted that to add apositive int due we move to the rive on ar number line and to add an negative integer we move to the left on ar number line we have also learnt that while using an number line for whole numbers to subtract three from five we start from the number five and then move three units to words the lear this gives five minus three which is equal to two now how would you sbstract negative three from five would you move towards the left on the number line or to words the ride if we move to wrds left we end up at two that is five minors negative three equals two but this is not true as we know five minus three equal to and thus five minus three is not equal to five minus negative three so we have to move to words the ride in this way we give five minus negative three equals ad this shows when we subtract ar negative integer from ar positive integer we get a greater integer we can also interpret this in another way we know that the additive inverse of negative three is positive three thus it seems that five minus negative three is the same as five plus the additive inverse of negative three to re in force this concept let us find tative trans negative four minus negative six using an number line using the earlier observation this is same as negative four adde to positive six as additive inverse of negative six is positive saves so to find negative four minus negative six we move six units to the ride we end up at positive to that is negative four plus positive six equals positive two which further gives negative four minus negative six as positive to hence to subtract in integer from another integer it is sufficient to add the additive inverse of the integer that is being subtracted from the other integer to get ab thorough an the standing about this let solve an example evaluate negative forty eight minus negative forty to minus negative five we call that to subtract an integer from ar given integer we add the additive inverse of the inter that is being subtract ive from the given integer this gives negative forty eight minus negative forty to minus negative five equals negative forty eight plus fortyqwo plus five which further gives negative forty eight plus forty seven that is negative one this we call the two important observations which we learnt here when we subtract ar negative integer from ar positive integer we get a greater integer to subtract an integer from ar given integer we add the additive inverse of the integer that is being subtracted from the given integer,"['positive integer', 'number positive', 'city new york', 'numbers positive', 'negative integer', 'trans negative', 'positive', 'new york', 'negative', 'ab thorough', 'earlier observation', 'additive inverse', 'instance stake', 'integers asitan', 'degree celsius', 'united states', 'north eastern', 'integer', 'city', 'number', 'int', 'side', 'minimum', 'trans', 'numbers', 'important', 'instance', 'integers', 'north', 'states']"
Representation of Integers on Number Line and Their Ordering, we know that the collection of integers includes natural numbers zero whole numbers and the negative of nature numbers do you remember that we can represent whole numbers on an number line on this number line any whole number is at a unit distance from its previous whole number it means the number one is at a unit distance from zero the number to is at a unit distance from one the number three is at a unit distance from the number to and so on now to represent the negative numbers on the number line we need to extend the number line in the oppose nirection we mark the points on the left of zero keeping the same with of the interval as we do for the whole numbers label the marks starting with negative one at the first mark that is to the left of zero negative to at the second mark negative three at the third mark and so on numbers to the right of zero are positive integers and numbers to the left of zero are negative integers zero is neither positive non negagair the arrows at both in of the number line shows that we can extend the number line in both terlirectionce in less lay can you figure out how can we mark numbers on the number line lets learn this in order to mark positive five on the number line start from zero and move five steps to the right of zero to mark negative numbers on the number line see negative three start from zero and move three steps to the left of zero in asimilar way to mark negative six on the number line start from zero and move six steps to the left of zero now we will learn how to compare integers using the number line but before that let test us as the nariorecarindas there is ar well in adeetvedge this well has twenty steps down to the bottom there are nine steps down to the water level to decide how much water during have ring fall would come into the well we legus mark the existing level of the water as zero level and one two three for and so on above that level for each star after the heavy rainfall they find that the water level of the well increases up to the fifth star due to the shortage iv water for up coming fumones we will use the water from be well because of the continuous use of water from be well the water level in the well decreases four steps below the zero la now the began to think about making the steps to notice the drop in the water level can you help them with this yes its easy to distinguish the numbers that are above zero from the numbers that are be low zero we can put are minor sine before them as we studied in integers so one step below zero was marked as negative on two steps below zero as negative two and so on the level of water is now at negative for after that due to further use the water level dropped vi one and it was at negative fine from this you can say that negative five is less than negative for because the water level decreases now lets go back to the number line and recall how we compare two whole numbers on the number line we already know that for given two whole numbers on the number line the one on the left is smaller and the one on the right is larger for example seven is greater nun fine in the same way we can define the relation between integers by looking at their positions on the number line here six is to the right of two on the number line so six is greater than to and zero is to the left of five on the number line so zero is less than fine or we can say that zero is to left of every positive integer so zero is less than every positive integer zero is to the right of negative four on the number line so zero is greater than negative for negative to is to the right of negative six on the number line so negative to is greater than negative sags similarly negative seven is to the left of negative four on the number line so negative seven is less than negative for as zero is to the right of every negative integer on the number line so zero is larger than every negative integer further zero is night or or positive integer nor an negative integer every negative integer is to the left of every positive integer so every negative integer is less than every positive integer thus we conclude that the number increases on annum mberline as we move to the right and decreases as we move to the left to re in force the concept just discussed let solve an example arrange the following numbers in descending order negative one eight negative seven three negative four to find the required descending order we first mark these numbers on the number line we observe the order of these numbers from right to left which gives the descending order of these numbers as eight three negative one negative four and negative seven now lets take one more example where we will arrange the given numbers in ascending order here the numbers are for negative for negative two zero an negative sex to find the required ascending order we first mark these numbers on the number line we observe the order of these numbers from left to right which gives the ascending order of these numbers as negative six negative for negative two zero and four now let we call what we have learnt till now integers can be represented on or number line are shown here numbers to the right of zero are positive integers and numbers to the left of zero are negative integers zero is neither ar positive integer nor ar negative integer we can use this number line to compared to integers by looking at their positions on the number line we observe that zero is less than every positive integer zero is larger than every negative integer every negative integer is less than every positive integer the number increases on or number line as we move to the right and decreases as we move to the left,"['mark negative numbers', 'mark negative', 'negative numbers', 'order negative', 'mark numbers', 'whole numbers', 'mark positive', 'negative', 'ascending order', 'whole number', 'positive non',

Introduction to Negative Number, lets play game of numbers with the help of for red and the green die again we will throw red and green die simultaneously then we will subtract the number that appears on the red die from the number that appears on the green die who that great fun let me that first no problem you can start first i get six and the green die and three on the red die can you tell me the result six minus three is equal to three yes it is the rid no it is your done iget five on green die and for on red die now you tell me the result if is subtr for from five iv will get one so five minus for is equal to one you are absolutely died now its your turn i get same number that is to on board the die what will be the result since bore the numbers are same so after subtraction we will get thredo therefore to minors to is equal to zero now let me throw sure iget to on green de whereas three on red die how much we will get if we subtbigor number from as smaller number iamalittle but confused can you answer this time am also confused let me call my mother to get answer yes she will definitely help us mother we help us in coming what is the problem how much we will get if we subtract three from two let me explain with the help of number nine here we are trying to subtract bigger number three from smaller number two for this first we move two steps right side from zero now to supra three from to we have to move three steps left from two this way we will reach one step behind zero we need to use the sign for numbers less than zero so amino sign is attached to the number to indicate an number is less than zero these number is are called negative numbers therefore to minors three is equal to minors one which is the negative number if we move further left on the number line we will get more negative numbers tanks man,"['negative number', 'negative numbers tanks', 'number', 'negative numbers', 'red die', 'amino sign', 'sure iget', 'great fun', 'numbers', 'right', 'die', 'sign', 'iget', 'red']"
Addition of Integers on a Number Line, we now that intrges can be represented on an number line the numbers to the left of zero or pole negative integers and the numbers to the right of zero or pad positive integers can we us sthis number line to at integers yes we can we will take realisinarios to on the stands are and william or planar game in which they are moving forward and backward forward steps are denoted by positive integers whereas the backward steps are denoted by negative integers here we want to find their final positions with risstep to their starting positions ammiwalks four steps forward and then another six steps forward how far is she from her starting point to find this let us first represent this sinario mathematically ammi moves four steps forward so that will be or positive for then she walks another six steps forward so it will be or positive sex we need to add these two numbers to get her final position how can you find this sum on the number line while looking at or number line we always start with zero fus ammiwalks four steps forward so move four steps in the positive direction on the number line then she continue six steps forward so move six morsteps in the same direction this way we end up at positive ten this gas four ple six equals positive ten thus ammi is stem steps to the right of where she started from now william walks four steps forward and then walk six steps backward how far is he from his starting point lets write or ex stression fire william moves four steps forward so that will be or positive for then he walk six steps backward that is in the opposite direction so it will be or negative sex we need to add these two numbers to get his final position how can you find this sum on the number line here william moves four steps forward so move four steps in the positive direction on the number line and then he moves six steps backward so we move six steps in the opposite direction on te number line and ends at negative to hence for plus negative six equals negative to thus william is two steps behind from where he started let take another cinario mathe and beta are staning at the same pine mathe took for steps backward and another six steps backward what is the current position of mathe relative to where peativeie standing again lets right or expression for mathe fours took four steps backward so it will be or negative for then another six steps backward so it will be or negative sex on adding these two we get the expression negative for plus negative sex on the number line we move four steps in the negative direction then again six step in the same negative direction this way we end up at negative ten so negative four plus negative six equals negative ten hence mathe is stem steps backward to where peter is stand in let take the last scenario lets co in the first round of the gas posnegative for his second round core was positive sex what four this final score in order to find breps final co we will add up the two scores that is negative for plus positive see again we will find this sum using the number line the first number is negative for so we move four steps in the negative direction on the number line the second number is positive see so we change or lirection and move six steps in the positive direction of the number line this way we end up at positive to so negative for plus positive six equals positive to hence bits final score in the gas tunement to was positive too now observe the four cinarios we conclude that when ar positive integer is added to an integer the resulting integer becomes greater than the given intrger when ar negative integer is added to an integer the resulting integer becomes less than dnegiven integer now let us rid to add positive five and negative five using an number line we start with zero on the number line and first move five units to the right to reach positive five then we move backwards five units to the left where do we reach eventually here we note that positive five plus negative five equal zero in a similar way when we are positive for and negative for we get zero numbers such as positive five and negative five positive for and negative for when added to each other gives the sum zero such numbers are called additive inverse of each other thus two integers whose sum is zero are called additive inverses of each other they are also called the negatives of each other now let some arise some important points learned here when a positive integer is added to an integer the resulting integer becomes greater

Animal Cell: Cytoplasmic Organelles, in typical animal cell the cell or the plasma membrane defines the outermost boundary of the cytoplasm thus in an animal cell the cell membrane maintains its integrate and shape the cell membrane is mainly madepaf lipid layers that is bile in which the protine molecules are in mated the membrane is selectively permeable in nature and thus regulates the flow of materials into and out of cells the part of to protoplasm present between the cell membrane and the nucleus is called cytoplasm the cytoplasm of an animal cell is at transparent viscous pale less fluid in the cytoplasm various organels are present and each is concerned with some specific function the cytoskeleton is an network of fibers throughout the cytoplasm of cell it is the structural framework of ace that helps in maintaining its shape and facilitates cellular motility the cytoskeleton is an organised network of three primary rotine filaments microtubules microfilaments and intermediate filaments all the activities occurring in ace require energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate or ity py the mitocondri are a site of atipy formation and thus these are also known as thopower house of acell mitocondria are rod shaped structures present in eukaryotic cells these range from zero point five tough one micrometers in diameter their number varies from one cell to another amitocondrian is a cytoplasmic organel with double membranes which surround the fluid filled space of mitopondrial metric the auto membrane allows low molecular weight molecules to freely diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other on the other hand the inner membrane of the mitopondria is highly convoluted forming he series of infoldings called crista crista provide and increased surfaceria for all the enzymatic reactions that ace in the mitopondrial matrix the mitocondrial ratrics is at dense gel like prutinacious material the mitocondria are the site of cellular respiration clucos and oxygen react to give carbon dioxide and water and energy is released in the form of atipi ribosomes are small dense rounded and granulopaticls the either acafreely in the cytoplasm or remain attached to the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear membrane protein this is takes place in ribosomes the endoplasmic reticulum is an extensive and accomplex network of inter connecting membrane systems which join the nuclimembrane at one end functionally and structurally two types of endoplasmic reticulum have been recognise these are granular or rough endoplasmic reticulum an granular are smooth endoplasmic reticulum the endoplasmic reticulum is composed of three different types of structures cisternae vesicles antibules the endoplasmic reticulum acts as the supported framework for as cell some of the important functions for for med by the endoplasmic reticulum involve synthesis and transport of proteins and fats the golgi complex is about one to three micrometers in length and is scattered throughout the cytoplasm mainly near the nucleus the golgi complex like the endoplasmic reticulum consists of three main parts systole tubules and vesicles the golgi complex is mainly involved in the packaging of materials that have to be either delivered to the intra cellular targets or secreted outside cell the next organelle that we encounter in an animal cell is the vacuole in he typical animal cell the vacuole is not as prominent as in or plant cell and the cytoplasm occupies almost the entire cell animal cells are fewer and smaller vacuoles the vacuole is enclosed by as single membrane the vacuole is filled up with the vacuole cell the cell sap is composed at water final salts at seta the vacuole serves as aside for storage and for

Heating Effect of Electric Current, heating effect of electric current you must be knowing that to run any appliance or gaget some source of energy is required to maintain the flow of electric current in the appliance the source has to keep sending its energy but where does this energy go let us understand we often observe that an electric fan becomes worm if it is used continuously for along time the same thing happens with mobile phones its outer cover becomes hot when the phone is used continuously this shows that some part of the energy in supplying the electric current is consumed in doing useful work like rotating the blades of of fan or running an application on or mobile phone rest of the energy is dissipated as heat which raises the temperature but what happens when the circuit is purely resistive that is or resistance in the form of or wire is directly connected to the back re terminals in such a cast energy is continually dissipated completely in the form of heat this is called heating effect of electric current can you think of some applications where this effect is utilised direct electric heater an electric an but the question is how the heat is generated in these appliances the heat is generated dy to the collision of electrons with the iron inside the wire the more the number of electrons flow per second the more is the number of collisions the more the number of collisions the higher is the resistance offered by the wire and hence larger is the amount of heat produce if in time tt the charge flowing through the wire is cue and the potential defence across it is we then the source is supplying the energy which is equal to we cow the paper in puto the circued by the source is the product of we and eye the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time tea is pave t into time ti what happens to this energy spent by the source this energy gets dissipated in the resister as heat thus for the steady flow of current the amount of heat produced in time tea is is equal to we pit we call the mathematical eression of on low the expression will become h is equal to eyes care art this is known as jewels law of heating this law can be used to find the heat produced by an electrical appliances,"['mobile phone', 'electric', 'electrical appliances', 'jewels law', 'mathematical eression', 'potential defence', 'cast energy', 'useful work', 'outer cover', 'same thing', 'heating effect', 'time', 're', 'flow', 'phone', 'mobile', 'law', 'heating', 'appliances', 'effect', 'energy']"

Sexual Reproduction in Plants, how you ever thought about the journey of seed nearly most of the plants you see are germinated from seeds when plants get mature they develop flowers and ready to reproduces you may also have notice that are flower wither of naturally of to sort an period of time why does this happen this happens because fall living organisms are model in nature how does the continuty of life exist it exists as all living organisms reproduce and leave the progeny to maintain the continuity of life on the earth usually it is observed that simple life forms follow asexual mode while complex once follow sexual mode of reproduction so what about the flowering plants flowering plants follow sexual mode of reproduction to produce their young ants lets find out how sexual reproduction takes place in flowering plants this process involves the fusion of me and female gametes to from an new individual do you know which part of of plant produces these gametes the gametes are produced in the most attractive part of fa plant which is of flower at typical flower consists of accessory parts and essential parts the accessory parts of fa flower are calyx and corolla the collects is at the most part of fa flower usually green in colour and consists of sepals whereas corolla is the second accessory part of the flower consisting of petals do you know why are they called the accessory parts that's because they are not involved in reproduction in addition to accessory parts are flower also has stamen and couple these are the essential parts of aflower now you can easily predict while they are called the essential parts exactly that's because they are involved in the process of reproduction stamen consists of anther and filament filament is are stock like structure that holds the anther now take are close look of an anther what did you observe there are four pollen sacs in an anther what is there inside the pollen sacs each pollen sac contains numerous pollen grains when he mature anther dehisces pollen grains are released from it now let us talk about the female reproductive part which is atople ar couple consists of stigma style and ovary the style holds the sticky stigma and overycontains many ovules which contain the ex cells now you might be thinking that how the male gamete reaches the excel if plants can not move you must have seen that when ar be sites on the flower to such its nectar are yellowish powder stick to its body what is that pouresupstions that the pollen release from the anta and when the beeflie to another flower insert of nectar it brushes the pollen from its body on the sticky stigma this unintentional help provided by be focilitates polynation so here abeacts as apolinating agent which helps to trans for the pollens from anther to stigma of aflover by the process called pollination if the pollens are transferred from anther to stima of are same flower it is known as self pollination on the other hand if the pollens are trans for from anther of one flower to stigma of another flower it is known as cross pollination now can you guess which mode of pollination leads to more genetic variations of course the cross pollinated flowers show wide variations in their characteristics now you might be von ring that what would happen if the pollen of one species lands on the stigma of under the species of flower always remember that pollen terminates only when it lands on the receptive stigma so when mature pollen reaches the stigma of of flower it contains two nuclei at generative nucleus and are vegetative nucleus the pollen green absorbs the sure secretions of the stigma swells up and ruptures or pollen tube grows to the style deriving nourishment from the tissues of the style within the pollen tube the generative nucleus divides mitotically to form two male gametes but what does of vegetative nucleus to exactly the vegetativ nucleus helps in the elongation of the pollen tube ultimately the pollen till breaches the embryo sac through the opening called micropyle the vegetative nucleus degenerates at the stage out of the two male gametes one fertilises the excel forming a diploid zygote while the other fuses with the two polar nuclei to form atriploid cell so after fertilisation zygote develops into an embryo ovule develops into a seed and ovary develops into a fruit

Portal flow, in addition to the normal pathway of the blood from the heart to the arteries via the capillaries into the vein and back into the heart blood in certain organs follows the different root the blood from the intestine flows through the hepatic portal vein back into another capillary bed of the liver instead of going to the right atrium through the veins the flow of blood from one capillary bed into another capillary bed is called the portal flow,"['certain organs', 'heart blood', 'normal pathway', 'portal', 'heart', 'blood']"
Cell Cycle, new cells arise from pre existing cells through the process of cell division it involves various events by which he cell duplicates phase genome synthesises phe other constituents of the cell and eventually divides into two these sequences of events constitute the cell cycle the cycle of cell replication or cell division can be broadly divided into two phases interphase during which the cell grows and mitotic phase or phase in which the cell divides into phases the gap between two successive stages of cell division that is mitosis it is an important prepare tree phase as throughout this phase the cell is encased in growth and metabolic activates this phase is divided into phase sub phases gone as and ge to the first sub phase of into phases known as ge one or first growth phase in this phase syntheses of protene and are near cells the cell increases in mass and organelnumber to prepare itself for cell division as phase orcinphetic phase follows gone phase you can polit the the ones synthesis phase which typically lasts for about seven to nine hours in this phase gene replicate the phase following as phase phase ge to or generative phase to it is the phase for preparation of mitosis ge to phase in vas syntheses of protinsanin sines required during the process of cell division the next phase after ge to phase is the mitotic phase the cell is now ready to go through mitosis it is also known as the divisional phase or end phase it comprises of two sub phases geriocanesss and cytokinesis the roses of cariocynesses takes phasinfosub phases namely prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase the encased division of the new phase the first phase of mitosises called prophase during this phase chromatin condenses into dish chromosomes each composed of two sister chromates the metaphase caliterised by the arrangement of all the chromosomes at the equatorial plate of the cell during anaphase chromosome arranged at the metaphase plate split and the two data chromates begin to migrate to words the two opposite cos at the beginning of the tile of phase or the final phage of mitosis the chromosomes which have rated their respective bows decondense appear as the mass of chromatin material this is followed by the assembly of nuclear envelope around the chromatin after the segregation of chromosome cariochinnesses the selprepares of self to divide into two daughter cells by cytokinesis once or cell has completed the cell cycle it goes back into the ge one phase and repeats the cycle again some cells in the body remain in an non dividing state called the gap not phase ge not or chosen the cell cycle is of fundamental process and in all cells it is regulated by series of ordered and directional molecular events and regulated by an elaborate sister that if fate good result in physiological damage most notably cancer and even death of the cell,"['phase phase ge', 'first sub phase', 'phase sub phases', 'phase chromatin', 'first phase', 'phase ge', 'synthesis phase', 'phase syntheses', 'phase', 'molecular events', 'metaphase plate', 'metaphase anaphase', 'cell', 'sub phases', 'final phage', 'data chromates', 'sister chromates', 'dish chromosomes', 'protinsanin sines', 'vas syntheses', 'successive stages', 'chromatin', 'good', 'bows', 'other', 'events', 'first', 'anaphase', 'plate', 'metaphase', 'prepare', 'cells', 'ge', 'phases', 'sister', 'nuclear', 'chromosomes', 'process']"
Cell Cycle Regualtion, all stages of cell cycle are controlled by check points the proteins which regulate the cell cycle function at three check points these check points access the readiness of the cell to proceed to the next age the first check point is the given check point or restriction point this check point make sure the cell is large enough to enter the pays this the cell cis is proper and de any has not been damaged the cell enters the space the second check point is ge to check point this check point make sure the genes completely replicated and replication errors have been repaired and the cell is now large enough to divide if these events do not acrcellcycle is arrested at this check point the third check point is the metaphase or em phase check point this check point makes sre that chromosomes are lit on spindle ready for cell division here is the spindle cycles are not formed properly or if their attachment to the kind ate pore is not ate quet might or cells is the rest age this is how cells in sure that only normal healthy cells are produce failure of any of these check points results and increase genetic damage like in cancer cells the forty check points make the cells unable to check the various event cycornt inside the cell,"['check point', 'ate quet might', 'check', 'healthy cells', 'cell cycle', 'various event', 'genetic damage', 'replication errors', 'cells', 'cell', 'ate', 'spindle', 'age', 'point']"

Introduction to Volume of Combinations of Solids, in our daily life we observe many objects like toys weakls vessels tools et cetera which are the combination of two or more solids the objects which are made of the combination of two or more solids are known as combined solids have you ever thought of how can we find out the volume of he combination of solids the volume of the combined solid is equal to the sum of the volumes of the solids which are combined together the given solid is the combination of the hemisphere and the cone thus the total volume of the solid is the sum of the volumes of the hemisphere and the cone let say some more examples this vessel is in the vorm of he hemisphere surmounted by cylender what is the volume of this vessel the total volume of the vessel is the sum of the volumes of the hemisphere and the cylender the given circus tent is erected in the form of he cone sumounted on acylender the total volume inside the circus tent is equal to the sum of the volumes inside the cone and the cylender an ice cream is in the shape of he cubvoid surmounted by a half cylender the total volume of the ice cream is equal to the sum of the volumes of the cuboid and the half cylender in this way we can find out the volume of various objects that are the combination of different solids,"['weakls vessels tools et', 'more solids', 'total volume', 'daily life', 'objects', 'more', 'solids', 'cylender', 'volume']"
Section Formula and Midpoint Formula, ni is solving ac cordinatio problem ni first to find the distance between two given points to one and b negative thr six then he needs to find the cordinates of point b that divides the line segment ab in the ratio to is to three ni is aware of the distons formula and thus applies it in finding the distance between and b which is we rot of fit but he does not know how to find the point b let us help him out this section formulae as to fine b it helps us to find the cordinates of point on as segment which divides the segment in the given ratio we do this through the section formula in this figure point b on the line segment ab in ex ibn divides ab in the ratio mis to nd let us state the cordinates of as ex one ion of b as xy and of basx to way to draw propene poles ac bu and bb from the points bp and b respect to ex axes so the co dinate of swallb ex on zero of cu will be zero and of bb ex to zero so what is the measure of cu and pub cu equals ex minus ex one and pub equals ex to anus consider vs as equation one and two but segments c and bb are parallel to h other do you know why we know this de to the property of intercepts of three parallel lines in this figure line less parallel to line nm and line nd line b and line re trans versus so by upon bcquals be upon ef this is the property of intercept of three parallel lines therefore ab upon bb equals cu upon pub equals m upon nm substituting the values of co and bud from equations one and two we get ex minus ex one upon ex to minus ex equals m upon nd on simple find it for the we get xequls m times ex to plasmtimes ex one hall upon mplas nm similarly we can sales for by join prependicular is to the ixes from bp and b we get why equals m times way to plus m times ion hall upon mpas nd therefore bc ordinates of point bp are m times ex to plus ntimes one hall upon m plus nd and mtimes wide to plus nd times one call upon mplasn the point bdivites the line segment ab when the cordinat ex on ion and b ex to way to in the ratio m is to this is called section formula on the section formula we can divide that if the ratio in which bdivinesb is is to one then the cordinates of the point bulb tin ex to plus ex one upon plus one and times wide to plus iv an upon plus one do you know that we can de due the mid point formula from the section formul that we just is cast al line segment is divided vis mid point in the ratio one is to one we can use it in the section formula here the point bp divides the segment ab in the ratio one is to one let the cordinat of ab ex or ion and of bb ex to way to then substituting in the section formula we get the cordinates of b as ex one plus ex to upon to win plus vi to upon to this is called the mid point formula let is now help ma in this figure be divides ab in the ratio to is to three so ab upon bb equals to upon three to find the cordinat of we will use the mid point formula considering as ex on ion b as ex to vi two m as to and m as thr and then on substituting the values of man in the fextion formula we get bequals zero three to we in for the understanding of section formula lets discuss an example let band cu be the points of trisection of the line segment joining the points with cu ordinates three negative two and be with coordinates negative six one be is nearer to let the coordinates of bb ex and in and kb extash and ideas we divide by in the ratio one is to to the coordinates of and we are given on applying the section formula we can calculate the coordinates of the coordinates of bar zero negative one cu lies midway between band b the coordinates of pr zero negative one and we are negative six one applying the mid point formula we can get the coordinates of cu as negative three and zero can the section formula we flies if the point that divides the given line segment externally in the given ratio yes there is formula to find the coordinates of point that divides the given line segment externally in agiven ratio but this formula is bit different from the one for internal division we will study about this formula in later classes lets discuss an example of external division with the help of the formula for internal division appointcew divines the line segment joining two points p negative two three and or two negative von in the ratio four is to one externally what are the coordinates of cu cu divides bar in the ratio four is to one externally so we cue upon our cu equals four upon one be cu is larger than or cu so our lies between band and cu mine source equals pre be cu equals fork and or cu equals one ga be are equals three so we are upon or cu equals three upon one ga equals three upon one therefore our divides cu in the ratio three is to one applying the section formula and simplifying we can gate the coordinates of cu as ten upon three and negative seven upon three there is one more example the exact is intersects the line segment joining the points p with cordinat four and negative three and are with ordinates negative three and seven find the ratio in white the ex axes divides the line segment and also the coordinates of the point of intersection let point cu we equordinate ex zero on the eeaxes intersect bar in the ratio is to one on applying the section formula we get the cordinates of cu as negative three tinesk plus for call upon cplas one and seven times teplas negative three call upon kplas one consider this as equation one but we know that the wicordinate of cu is zero so we gate seven times gy plus negative three hall upon be plus on equals zero on simplification we get bp equals for upon six or two upon three so the ratio in which divides bar is two is two three we can substitute equals for upon six in the equation one and get the value of ex as six upon five so the coordinates of are six upon five zero here is the were cap of what we have learnt so far,"['m times ex', 'line nd line b', 'times teplas

Idea of Force, maria and her brother john need to put a heavy box up on this platform the think of three different approaches to put the box on the platform which of these methods do you think will be the easiest lets try each to find out first maria and john try to lift the box this proves to be very difficult since the box is very heavy the heavier the object more is the effort required to lift it then jn comes up with an idea he ties ar rope to the box and cling on top of the platform he then holds the free end of the rope and tries to pull the box towards himself the rope helps in reducing the effort however the task still remains and fulfilled the effort required to pull the box towards the platform is huge now maria comes up with an idea she places ap plant inclined to the platform like this they both manage to place the heavy box on the inclined blank now the task becomes simpler john pulls the box to words himself using the rope while mariapushes it away from her the efforts maria and john putting together in the form of pushing pull make the task simpler the heavy box is easily placed on the platform when marind john were pushing and pulling the box respectively the eraplined force on it it is this force which made the box move away from maria and towards jon force hence is defined as the push on pull on an object if push and pull are both forces what is the difference between them well they are forces which are opposite in nature when force is applied on an object such that the object moves away from the source of the force it is called push when he for is applied on an object such that the object moves towards the source of the force it is called pull lets now say some examples of push and pull you might have played with magnets what happens when you bring to magnets close to each other either one of the magnet is pulled towards the other or when of the magnets pushes the other away from it think about gravity this is what pulls everything down towards the earth gravity is are force to which acts on the form of ar pull force when he player kits of football it goes away can you guess the action applied in this case yes acting of football is he kind of push force in the game of cricket ar player hit the ball with the bat hitting is again a kind of push so terms like hitting kicking striking hammering can be replaced with the single term called force you must have now understood how push and pull to find force think of more instances of force acting around you and categorise them as push or pull,"['ar pull force', 'simpler john', 'ap plant inclined', 'ar player', 'force', 'pull lets', 'magnets close', 'object such', 'inclined blank', 'free end', 'easiest lets', 'different approaches', 'heavy box', 'john', 'ar', 'maria', 'simpler', 'player', 'pull', 'magnets', 'object', 'heavy', 'box']"
Law of Conservation of Matter, every country including in tea has specific laws for ensuring the good quality and safe life of it citizons chemicals are no exceptions when they react they follow certain laws the laws that govern any chemical reaction taking place between redious substances are known as laws of chemical combination the are five laws of chemical combination which include the law of conservation of matter the law of constant proportions the law of maltipal proportions the law fore the procal proportions and the gadlusax law of gaseous volumes here we will learn about the law of conservation of matter but before that let us recall about daltons atomic theory to tons atomic theory explains the nation of matter which plays an important role in the fombination of laws of chemical combinations and writing the chemical combine of compounds the important points of daltons atomic theory are as follows all matter whether an element are compound or a mixture is made of very tiny particles called attens an atom can neither be created nor destroyed atoms of the same element have identical masses while the atoms of different elements have different masses at ms of the same or different elements combined together to form molecules or compounds the law of conservation of matter was established by friend scientist and tin davogier in the year seventeen hundred and eightyfile this law states that during achemical reaction the total mass of the products is equal to the total mass of the reactions of we can say the mass of matter neither increases nor decreases during achemical reaction lets go to the laboratory and perform some experiments to prove the law of conservation of matter for the first experiment we require digital balance calcium oxide water ar beaker and as pathula to begin take fifty six gram calcium of side in the beaker and potwentymili later of water into it now if you touch the beaker you will feel it is hot it shows that the reaction is exothermi leave the beaker undisturbed for some time after some time you will observe that most of the salt has settle at the bottom of the beaker now no down the reading of van balance you will observe that the total mass of the reactions is equal to the total mass of the products so it can be concluded that during achemical change the total mass of the matter remains constant let us now prove the law of conservation of matter by reacting calcium chloride with sodium al fade fa this we require calcium chloride solution so the on sulphate solution hundred mililter conical flask testubes digital balance and arobacog take ten mililatur of sodium safaolution in the conical flask and ten mililatur of calcium oride in the tested after this the refully hand the test tube containing calcium lorie inside the conical flask with the help of arobacog now we the conichl flask along with the reactants on the digital balance no down the reading of the balance in the next step till and solve the conical flask so that the two solutions get mites again we the conical flask along with the products found no down the reading of the balance now compare both the was you will observe that bother was come out to be same so it can be concluded that during a chemical change the total mass of the matter remains constant so we can say that the law of conservation of matter helps us in understanding and determining about the mass of reactants and products during ar chemical reaction,"['balance calcium oxide', 'calcium chloride solution', 'chemical reaction', 'calcium chloride', 'sodium al fade', 'calcium', 'chemical', 'different masses', 'first experiment', 'total mass', 'tin davogier', 'friend scientist', 'same element', 'tiny particles', 'gaseous volumes', 'redious substances', 'citizons chemicals', 'safe life', 'good quality', 'atomic', 'proportions', 'balance', 'conical', 'important', 'law', 'laws', 'reaction', 'different', 'masses', 'sodium', 'solution', 'mass', 'same', 'element']"
Distance Formula, sit plants to visit his friend so we want to know the distance from his house to his friends house and in order to do that he lets at the gbs on his mobile sit wonders how distances are calculated on gbs can you help it on the gbs the cordinates of aplace or point are the termed by the latitude m longitude of that plays or point late would and longitude are the units that represen the cordinates in the geographic ordinates ton on agbs the distance formula is used to find the distance between two places or point let us find the distance betwen two points whose cordinatre none the points can lay at different places on plane let us see the various options on the basis of their location let points at ex one zero and b ex to zero lie on dx axes such that ex to is greater than ex one so the distance between points and bwillb ex two minus ex one let points and bly such that this segment ab is parallel to the ex axes it means that the whicordinates of and bar equal so the cordinat of will be ex one ion and that of bulb ex to by one draw segmence al and b merpentoler to ex axes the distance lm equals ex to minus ex one as both land m lie on the ex axes but ab m l is erect angle by construction so the distance bquals lm therefore the distance between and b is ex to minus ex one so we cancesay that the distance between any two points that lay on xaes or on the line parallel to ex axes is equal to the deferens the we there axes as let point b zero one and are zero way to lie on the way axes such that two is greater than one so the distance between bp and or will why to mains ion let points and s lie ac that the segment us is parallel to the way axes it means that the ex cordinates of cu in sa equal so the ordinates of will bexwoney one and that of silb ex one way to draw segments are int be perpendicular to way axes the distance be are equals way to minus one as both be and or on the way axes but as cube are is rectangle by construction so the distance is equals bar therefore the distance be tw cu and ses way to minus by one thus we can say that the distance between any two points that way on the way axes or on the line parallel to the way axes is equal to the distance betwe the ordinates let us understand the distance formula for any two points on ar plane on the ex why plain there are two points and bitcordinatx one way one and ex to by two respectively can you find the distance ab between these points to do this from point and b draw perpendiculars and bb respectivel on ex axes also from point draw perpendicular don bb can you tell the cordinat of the point by king at this figure bb is parallel to by axes so the ex cordinate of b is the same as that of be which is ex to disparalel to excess so the way cordinat of b is the same as that of which is way one therefore the cordinates of bar ex to way one observe that atrial ab bisformed in this figure what tip of triangle is this bb is the it angle triangle according to the by tigers run in arightangle triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the remaining two sides so in the rt angle trying bb the square of ab equals the sum of square bus beds quit to it of this as equation one the distances or emequals ex one and or bequals ex two therefore the distance b equals ex to minus ex one also the distance bequals the distance em which is ex to minus ex one similarly bb equals why to minus by one we placing the values of dy and bb in equation one we get ab squared equals ex to min sex ne holesquare plus why to minus why one whole squared so ab equals square root of ex to min sex one whole squared plus why two minus yone whole squared this is call the distance formula it is used to find the distance between two points cos cord nets are known the distance formula can help us to solve many problems let us understand some of them what is the distance between two points negative one zero and b three one let ab ex one ion and bb ex to two on substituting these values in the distance formula and solving it further we get ab equals square root of seventeen to the points seven ten negative two five and or three negative for former triangle if yet we the tip of the triangle formed we use the distance formula to find the distances be cu are and are let b seven ten b b ex one ion negative two five b ex to two and are thr negative for b ex three vi three substituting the values of ex one hi one and ex to two in the distance formula we find the length of bu we cu equals the square root of the sum of seven minus negative to whole squared plus ten minus five whole squared on simplifying it for the we get be co equals the square root of one hundred and six similarly on solving for cu are we find that cu are equals the square root of one hundred and six on solving for par we find that we are equals square root of two hundred and twelve square root of one hundred six plus square root of one hundred sixes more than the square root of two hundred twelve so the sum of two sides is greater than the third side this means that we are is at triangle also b squared equals one hundred six cu are squared also equals one hundred and six and be re square equals to hundred twelve what does this can war we observe that two hundred and twelve equals one hundred six la one hundred six that means be are squared equals the sum of bc squared and cu are squared by by the good as drum shows that the points b and are form are right angle triangle we also know that be is equal to cu are so it is an is sols in these fringe also with the help of the distance formula show that the given points one negative one b five to and c nine five are collinear using the distance formula we get be equal to five we see also equals five and cequal ten therefore we conc that be plus bc equals tan which is equal to three points bands are collinear if the sum of the lens of any two line segments among ab bc and sa equal to the

thousand species out of these some species are edible while others are very poisonous alimseppar commonly known as anion it is one of the edible species of lilac family that has been cultivated by humans or over five thousand years it is he perennial her with adventitious fibrous root system and its stem grows are to hundred centimetre to alien separ is acknowledged for its underground stem which is modified into tunicate ball these words are mostly uniform in shape sides and skin calor the shape of the bulb ranges from spherical to nearly cylindrical and sometimes flat of cone whereas the skin collar may be white brown red or purple the longitudinal section of the tunicate ball shows ar reduced stem in the centre and axillary buds surrounded by inner fleshy say leaves and outer membranous dry cason the top of the bulb are fleshy sheething base arises which develops to encircle the growth point and forms ice that encloses younger leaves and the shoot apes its foliage leaves are radical alternate sessile simple cylindrical hollow green and parallel wave the leaf blades are tubular slightly flatten on the adaxial side although hollow and closed at the tip the last foliage leave is the floral stock that is rigid hollow and waxy with escape the cap is in apical internode of the floral stack and develops into an in florasons during their budding stage each inflorecence is enclosed inside two to three membranous spade like large brakes thus the flowers are bracteate when buds begin to blosum these spread their spades and the flowers exposed in form of as spherical humble each in florisans bar bunch or flowers at various stages of their development and each of them is pedicelate the pedicels of the flowers are equal in length and spread from ar common point somewhat like umbrella rims each flower of alien sepa is white coloured and small in sides it is trimerous and actinomorphic more precisely the floral parts of each flower is arranged in multiplication of three and the flowers are radically cymetrical it has incomplete flower with only three words which are perianth and rushum the male reproductive organ and ganushum the free meal reproductive ogen all these three worlds are ranged successively on the thalamus or receptacl which is the swollen end of the pedisel each flower has both and rotor and ganusium therefore it is bisexual flower perhaps it exhibits both self and cross polonation the outermost whorl of the flower is periawhich consists of six steps arranged in two alternate sub worlds of three leech all temple are petiloid white with green midrib olifilus and show valvate estivation the next successive well is andrusium that consists of six stamens in two of worlds of three each opposite to tepal and epiphylis each stamen has long filament which is slightly dilated at the base and the long bilobed and besifixed anta at the apes gainosium of the flower is located at the sent it has three fused carples thus called try capillary and sin capas gainosium are short and filiform style minute stigma and superior ova each flower shows gainosium at the topmost position on the palamas therefore the other floral parts like tepples and the stamens are placed below the gainosium hence the flower is hypodynas the transversection of ovary shows three locus and each locule as two ovules arrangement of

most common weed reported all around the world was none other than solenumnigrum of solenesyfamil solenum nigrum seedlings can be identified by alternating leaves with maron coloured markings on their on the side solonumnigrum has tap root system with numerous laterally branch roots while about the soil stemizangula erect green and occasionally very hairy often with prices the leaves are alternately arranged on the stem generally they are exstipulate simple and stored with time shape blade the margin of leaves is thin and large tube in addition to that some leaves are pinnately divided into unequal lobes which are stipe like leaflets located on the base of the leaf solenumnigrum is an annual herb that grows are to one twenty centimetres it flowers from the month of july to september the seeds ripened between ages and october the flowers of solenumnigrum are born at the end of the axillary perencels with simost in florisans these flowers are arranged in ar cluster by means of apedicell and with auto brackthus flowers are pedicillate and ibratiede the flowers are small and size white in collar and star shape with the protruding yellow cone in the centre each flower has five regular parts with radial smatry thus it is an actinomorphic flower the flower is the complete one with all the four worlds calics corolla and rotium the male reproductive organ and gainotium the femial reproductive age all the four worlds of the flower are arranged successively on the thalamus or receptacl which is the swollen end of the pediser in the presence of both and grosiumand ganotiun plant predominantly exhibits self polonation therefore it is known as bisexual and autogamous floer out of all the four worlds calics is the outermost whorl of the flower it encloses and protects the inner worlds in the bud stage calics is gamosepals and shows valvate estimation it consists of five sepals which are hairy persistent and green in collar sepals are fuse together to form campanilate shape with five deep lobes the next successive world is known as corolla it consists of five white coloured petals fuse together inner form of wheel thus it is gamopetalous and has valvate estimation and rotium is the third world on the inner side of the corolla it consists of five stamens stamens are at need to the corolla thus called epipetas each stamen has short filament and biticus anthers anthers are yellow and besifics canosiumas located at the centre of the flower it has two fuse capos thus called bi capillary and sin caves each couple has long style by load capitade green collar stigma and superior ovary styles are long but do not extend beyond anthers in this section the topmost position of the gainotiun on palamus ester the other floral parts like the sepals the petals and the stamens are placed below the gainotiun thus the flower is called hypogynas flower transverse section of ovary shows two locus and each locus has many ovules arrangement of obvious shows

Plant Growth, plants have different cells to shoes and organs just like animals do the roots can grow deep underground they anchor the plants and the soil the root hair cells give roots a very large surface area so the water and mindrels can be absorbed efficiently plants have stems these usually grow upwards they carry water from roots to the leaves and food from the leaves to the rest of the plant this fine cornquellar buffet plant it has large leaves to absorb a lot of sunlight for photosynthesis,"['root hair cells', 'cornquellar buffet', 'large surface', 'different cells', 'large']"

Converse of BPT, everything in life has its own polar opposite you can't have left without ar ride and up without adown success without pale and so on in mathematics when you have atrum you likely have aconverse term do you know what converts means the converse of at term is equivalent to the opposite of the original term that is the furum in which the hypothesis and conclusion of the original term are used the can look at at re life example to on the stand in are better way suppose a statement says that if go to at football would cup then you like the game of football can you tell what the converse of the statement is the converse of the statement is if you like the game of football then you go to what football world car seems easy right lets look at this try with ar mathematical term you have already work with the basic proportionality term this there says if ar line is drawn pale to one side of a triangle to intersect we are the two sides in the stained points the other two sides are divided in the same ratio here the hypothesis is if ar line is drawn pale to one side of a triangle to in the sec the other two sides in the stand points and the conclusion is the other two sides are divided in the same ratio if you switch the hypothesis an the conclusion you get the following statement if aline divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio then the line is pallto the third side this is called the converse of basic proportionality tirem now the question is does this hold true all the time lets perform an activity to find the answer to this question draw an angle by and on the ray obey mark points be one ptw pthre be for and be such that the five parts in which the ray up is divided are equal in lend lets assume that each part is to units long similarly on re mark points on three for and cu such that the five parts in which the ray oy is divided are also equal in lend lets assume that each part is ne unit long now join be on one and cu can you find the ratio of opon to pan p and the ratio of ou one to cu on cu clearly the ratio of open to by an is to is to which is equal to one is to for and the ratio of ocean to one cu is one is to fall thus the ratio of opione to pan be is equal to the ratio of open to an also we observe that the line segment sp one cu on and are pale to thather you can verify this by measuring angles opvoneku von and bone bu the are of same measure thus by corresponding angles property line segments be one can and pu are pale to th ate lets name these two conditions together as relation on similarly by joining the points to to be three three and be for for we obtain relations to three and for respectively from relations one to three and for we can conclude that if ar line divides two sides of a triangle in the same ratio then the line is pale to the third side we can repeat this activity with an angle of any measure and taking equal number of parts on its arms each time we will arrive at the same resol thus the converse of ppt always holds true we will prove it now it is given that at lined intersects the sides ab and ac of thing bp respectively at d and such that the ratio of ab to bb is equal to the ratio of to c lets name this relation as one we have to prove that de is pale to bc we will prove it by using contradiction let us assume that d is not pale to bc so there must be some line pale to be stu de thus draw al line dif pale to bc since the vis ball to bc there for by bp w e have the ratio of ad to de b is equal to the ratio of if to fc lets name this relation as two from relations one and two we get the ratio of ftofc is equal to the ratio of to c by using component rule we get relation three which leads to relation for therefor vs is equal to c this is possible only when f and coincide that is de and de if are the same lines thus de is pallto bc hence proved we will now take some problems to illustrate the use of this result problem one says that in the given figure find whether be ispadlto ef or not to solve this problem we will find the ratio of dc to puf and the ratio of de ptop the ratio of de cu to cuf equals nine is to three that is equal to three and the ratio of dp to bp equals twelves to four which is also equal to three thus from above two relations we get the ratio of de to cuf is equal to the ratio of dp top hence be cu is padl to if by the converse of bp t it was cright lets try another problem problem to says that in the figure shown de is padltoob and df is palltooc you have to so that f is pall to bc lets try to solve it it is given that de is palltoob so the ratio of to b is equal to the ratio of ad to do by bp t lets name this relation as one again it is given that df is palltoo so the ratio of d to do is equal to the ratio of if to fc by bp t lets name this relation as two from relations one and two we get the ratio of to b is equal to the ratio of if to fc so if is pal to bc by using converse of bp dt,"['angles property line', 'ray

one more method of representing acentinuousata graphically you are already familiar with the cumulative frequency distribution the given information shows the sale of key bows and seventy days we call that there are two types of cumulative frequency distribution less than type and more than type first consider ac cumulative frequency distribution of this than type we call that the value ten twenty thirty and so on are the upper limits of the respective class intervals to represent the data given in the table graphically we will follow certain steps take ar graph paper and draw exantwy access on

be disame on body access now from the ordered pairs fate sing upper limits as exfcordenates and corresponding cumulative free sees as why codons now plot the points corresponding to these ordered

frequencecove of the more than type in the given frequency distribution pl we rot ten twenty firty and so on are the lower limits of the respective class intervals the graphical representation of the cumulative frequency of the more than type is slightly different from that of the less than type the first step is same as that of the less than type curve in the second step we plot the lower limits on the faces and the corresponding cumulative frequencies on the viaess now from the ordered pairs by using lower limit as ex for dinate and corresfponding cumulative frequencies as why codons now plot the points porresponding to these ordered pairs on the sex why plain doing all the points by or re hands smooth curve as shown here this is accumulate frequent curve or an or give of the more

the ex access which intersects the curve at apoipe now from this point draw or perpendicular to the ex access the point at which the perpendicular intersects the ex access is the median of the data in this case it is approximately thirty at similarly we can find the median using the modantie cumulative frequency curve now let us explore another retort of obtaining the median draw or gives of the less than type and of the more than type on the same access the two og ive intersect each other at a point from this point draw aperpendicular on the ex access the point at which at intersects the ex

Median of Grouped Data (Part 1), you are already aware that the median is the value which occupies the middle position when all the observations are arranged in an ascending or descending or th now observe this data any arrange this data in ascending order to find the median you can but it will take ar lot of time to we have any other method yes in such cases we divide the datineto groups so that is that with an example how the median of group to death as found consider or group to frequency distribution of weekly expenditure of one thousand families as shown from the table can ons or that how many families have weekly expenditure less than two thousand rupees clearly the answer is forty so the next question is how many families have weekly expenditure less than rupees four thousand is your answer to hundred if yes then its and correct so what would be the answer the answer will be the sum of the number of families who have expenditure from zero to two thousand and the number of families who have expenditure from two thousand to four thousand that is two hundred and forty this is the cumulative frequency of the class to thousand to four thousand we can write it in the table as shown similarly we can compute cumulative frequencies of other classes this distribution is call the cumulative frequency distribution of the is than tide can you find the middle observation by the king in the cumulative frequencies now as the middle observation will be some amilio in ar class interval and it will divide the whole distribution into two has but in which class this value should lie for this we need to locate the class whose cumulative frequencies greater than and nearest to an abound to and this is called the median class in the given data in is one thousand therefore and upon to with five hundred in the table the cumulative frequency of the class four thousand disixthousan this five hundred forty which is greater than and nearest to and upon two that is five hundred therefore four thousand to six thousand is their median class the lower class limit of the median class is four thousand and its frequency is three hundred in the table we conc that out of the first five hundred scores two forty course are less than four thousand so the remaining scores in median class is to hundred and sixty the class interval of the median class is two thousand so the median that is five hundred score candiavecola tet as shown and it is the proximal que to rupees five thousand seven hundred fifty three point three three for convenience we can formula this as plus in upon two minors upon multiplied by in the formula is the lower class limit of the median class and is the sum of frequencies it is the class interval of the median class if is the frequency of the median class and se is the cumulative frequency of the class preceding the median class from the table end is four thousand and is one thousand its two thousand is three hundred and see fic two forty on substituting all these values in the formula and solving it for the we get the median has rupee five thousand seven hundred thirty three point three three this means that the weekly expenditure of about fifty quersin families is less than rupees five thousand seven hundred fifty three point three three and the expenditure of remaining fee to per cent is more than this amount now consider the following frequency die tributiontabl which shows the lens of eightyto leaves collected for project if two leaves of lens five point five centimeture and tan point five centimetre are also collected for the project then in which interval will we include them we can not add them in any of the intervals we cars there are gaps and between the upper limit and the lower limit of two consecutive lausads thus we need to divide the intervals for that the upper and lower limits of consecutive intervals are the same for this we find the disfoens between the upper limit of ar class and the lower limit of its succeeding class how of this defences cytopoint five now we add is to point five to each of the upper limits and subtract the same from each of the lower limits in this way we get this new frequency distribution table now compare the previous frequency distribution table and his new table the class mark of irst interval of both the tables the same thus always remember that if the classes are made continues the class marks do not change now lets get back to are question where we have to include the leaves of length five point five centimetres and ten point five centimetres in the classes here the leaf of length five point five centimetres will be included in the class five point five to then point five centimetres thus the new frequency of this class is twenty one the leaf of length ten point five centimetres will be included in the class ten point five to fifteen point five centimetres thus the new frequency of this classes forte three in this way we get the final frequency distribution table showing the date of eighty four leads can you find the medium length of ar leaf yes you can for this we have to calculate the cumulative frequency of each class the cumulative frequency of ar class is the sum of the frequency of the class and the frequencies of all preceding classes here any equals eighty four therefore an appointto is forty two in the table the cumulative frequency of class ten point five to fifteen point five years seventy two which is greater than and nearest to an appoint to that is forty to therefore ten point five to fifteen point five is the medium class the lower class limit of the medium classes ten point five frequency is forty three cumulative frequency of the class preceding the medium classes twenty nine the class interval of the medium classes five this is the formula for calculating the medium we substitute all the values in the formula on simplifying we get the medium length of a leave as twelve point to zero one centimeters in this way you can solve any problem related to medium in another shell it is difficult to write this cores in the ascending or descending order when the number of scores is large so the data is classified into groups if the given classes are not continuous we have to make them continues to find out the medium it is not possible to find the exact medium of group to data

Median of Grouped Data (Part 2), we have already discussed how to find the median of grew to data by using the following formula but some finds the cumulative frequency distribution of the less than tin or the more than tie are given how will we calculate the median cores at distributions to know this let us first consider the cumulative frequency distribution of the less than tie the table given here shows the distance covered by fifty one bases in ar day how will you determine the median distance covered by of as the calculate the median distons we need to find the class intervals and their corresponding frequencies since the distribution is the less than type we have the upper limits of the corresponding class intervals since the distance must be positive number so the first class must be zero two hundred the upper class limit of the next classes two hundred so the secant class mass we hundred to two hundred similarly we obtain all the classes now we obtain the corresponding frequencies of each class interval observe the table there are four basis which cover the distons less than hundred so the frequency of the class zero to hundred is four now there are eleven passes which cover the distance less than two hundred and for bases cover the distance less than hundred therefore the number of passes cover the distance adenterval hundred to two hundred is eleven mind is four that is seven similarly we find the frequencies of order class intervals from the table the tally of emits fifty one therefore and upon to is twenty five point five now we locate the class whose cumulative frequencies greater than and nearest two twenty five point five cumulative frequency quenty nine is greater than and nearesto twenty five point five its corresponding classes two hundred to three hundred this is the median class the lower class limit of the median classes two hundred its frequency is eighteen the cumulative frequency of the class receding the median class is eleven and the class interval of the median class is hundred this is the formula for calculating the median we substitute all this radius in this formula on simple find we get the median distance as two hundred and eighty point five five cilometers now we consider the more than tip cumulative frequency distribution the following table shows accumulate frequenciedis tribution of the profit on by forty shops of as shopping male how will you determine the median profit end fire shop to calculate the median profit we need to find the class intervals there corresponding frequencies and their cumulative frequencies since the distribution is the more than type we have the lower limits of the corresponding class intervals the lower limit of the first class interval is five and its upper limit will be the lower lhemit of the next class interval that is ten the lower limit of the secant class interval is ten and its upper limit will be the lower limit of the met class interval that is fifteen in this way we obtain all the classes now we obtain the corresponding frequencies of fee class interval we observe that forty shops on the profit more than or equal to five since there are thirty eight shops which on profit more than or equal to ten this means that there are forty minors thirty eight that is two shops which earn the profit between five to ten lives continuing in the same manner we get the number of shops which are in the profit ten lax or above as thirty eight minus twenty sits that is twelve similarly we find the frequencies for other class intervals now that there is no for the entry as the sixteen so we write this as it is now we find the corresponding cumulat the frequency of each class the cumulative frequency of a class is the sum of the frequency of the class and the frequencies of all preceding classes so this is the final cumulative frequency distribution table for calculating the medium from the table the value of an is forty therefore and upon toes twenty now we locate the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than and nearest to twenty cumulative frequencequenty for is greater than and near is to twenty its corresponding class is twenty five to thirty this is the medium class the lower class limit of the medium classes twenty five its frequency is five the cumulative frequency of the class preceding the medium class is nineteen and the class interval of the medium classes five this is the formula for calculating the medium we substitute all these values in this formula on simplifying we get the medium profit as twenty six lack rupees in this way you can find the medium of less than and more than type cumulative frequency distributions in or not shall to calculate the medium of less than type cumulative frequency distribution we need to find the class intervals and their corresponding frequencies in the less than type cumulative frequency distribution upper limit of each class interval is given to calculate the medium of more than

Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables, we have learnt how to three equations if we are given with some conditions let us learn how to find the solution of ar pair of linear equations in two variables graphically at first let us see how alien equation in two variables can be represented on agraf true but three foot balls and two pairs of grapes for three hundred repeats suppose the price of one football is rupees ex and the price of one pair of groves is rupees vi so the given situation can be frame on the form of alnirequation as three express to vi equals three hundred let us fy to solve this problen it is at linear equation in two variables be has the exponents of the variables in old are one now how can the equation be represented on ar graph to represent this equation we ne to find ap pair of values of ex and that satisfy the equation in at to point values of ex and we if we take as zero we get ex as hundred and if we take ex as zero we get why as one fifty do you know why we have taken value zero for ex and why this is don so as to make or calculations and plotting of points easier however you can take any random value for ex and get value for vi so here we have the values of ex and why using these two pairs of values we can plot these points on the cartesian quain on joining these points we get as trait line all the two points are sufficient to represent ar line but it the potenates of one of the two points are grown then you will get an incorrect line if you plot three points and if they are known collinear then it is understood that one of the point is wrongleqloted but it is not easy to identify the incorrect poine on plotting these points on the graph you can observe that the point thirt one thirty is not on the given line but if we plot four points it is all most set on that three of them will bequallynea on plotting these points on the graph you can observe that the point forty eighty is not on the given line the correct point is forty ninety so here we have the values of ex and vi using these four pairs of values we can plot these points on the cartesian quain it is as simple graph but there are many pins which we can in for formed can you think of them all the points that lie on this line will be the solutions of this linear equation take any ran dm point fifty seventy five let us put ex as fifty and why as seventy five three ex plus to vi equals to three hundred three multiplied by fifty plus two multiplied by seventy five equals three hundred one fifty plus von fifty equals three hundred therefore let can side equals right hand side thus we can say that the point fifty seventy five lies on the line of the given equation now how thes the graph of two linear equations look like using two points zero one fifty and one hundred zero we have already drawn the graf of the equaion three ex plus to we equals three hundred take one more equation say ex min us to vi equals zero let us make at table for the second equation on this equation we get the potenates of the points as twenty ten and one fifty seventy five after plotting these points on the graph and joining them we get two straight lines all the points that lie on the first line will satisfy the first equation and all the points that lie on the second line will satisfy the second equation that is ex pin us to vi equals zero is there anything which you can not is from this graph locate the point where both the lines intersect this point lies on both the lines so this is the point which satisfies both the equations seventy five thirty seven point five is the solution to both the lines sin seventy five thirty seven point five is the only common point on both the lines it implies this set of lane equations will have only one solution which is vi this is could are consistent pair of linear equations do you think that appear of linear equations always has one solution can they have no solution or infinite solutions consider an example three ex plus vi equals eleven six sex plus to vi equals twenty to draw these equations one graph we need some points to plot let us rot two tables and find the quotient take random values of ex and get corresponding values of vi consi der equation one the excess equal eleven on taking ex as zero we get why equal eleven similarly for ex equals one we get why equal at in this way we get two points zero eleven and one eight consider equation to let ex as zero we get we equals ten let exist one we get why equal seven in this way we get two points for equation to zero ten and one seven using these points we gan plot the points on the graph and after joining them we get lines corresponding to the equations what do you observe if you are going to say that these lines are pale to each other then you are right they are paddle to each other what does it imply it implies that there is no common point that satisfies these two line equations this is another case where we observe that appear of linear equations has no solution which is why it is called an inconsistent pair of linear equations can appear of linear equations have infinitely many solutions lets explore it consider another pair of linear equations as two ex plus why equals fifteen texpless for why equal sixty to plot these equations graphically that random values of ex and get corresponding values of we for equation one if we take ex as zero we get why equal sixteen if we take why as zero we get ex equal seven point five so we get at table it shows values of ex and iv similarly for equation two we gexplesfourvy equal sixty if we take ex equals zero we get why equal sixteen if we take equal zero we get ex equals seven point five we have two tables for two lane equations plotting these points on the cartesian plane we get ar graph oh what do you observe interestingly they are running over each other in this case these pair of linear equations will have many solutions wih is why they are called as consistent pair

Perimeters and Areas of Similar Triangles, you might have understood by now that if two triangles are similar then their corresponding angles are congruent and their corresponding sides are in the same ratio let start with the simple example triangle bc and de if or similar ratio of their corresponding sides is one upon two how about the ratio of their perimeters and areas ratio of their perimiters is man upon at which is simplified as one upon two if the height of triangle bc is three centimetres and that of triangle de ef is six centimetres then the ratio of their areas is six upon twenty for which is simplified as one upon fold one upon for can be expressed as the ratio of perfect squares one squared upon two square what do you notes about at of the ratios found you might have noticed from he that there is an interesting patan is their any relationship among these ratios or is the coincident let strive with another par of similar triangles ratio of their sides is one upon tray ratio of their perimites is one upon trade and ratio of their areas is one upon three whole square is this again acoincidence now there is acoelation between the ratio of the sides and the ratio of the perimiters and areas of similar triangles ratio of the perimeters of the similar triangles is same as the ratio of their sides and ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides this example leads to the following term the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratios of their corresponding sides lets prove this term we are given two triangles bc and de if sac that triangle bc similar to triangle de if we need to proof that the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides for fanging the areas of the two triangles we draw altitudes al and dm of the triangles for our convenience we will divide the proof into four parts what is the area of triangle bc it is one upon two multiplied by bc multiplied by m note that this notation is used to represent area of triangle bc again what is the area of triangle de if it is one upon two multiplied by if multiplied by dm so the ratio of their areas is given by equation one now in trangle al by and triangle de my angle al by equals angle de am as each is aritangle an angle be equal angle since strange bc similar to triangle de if what can you say about the similarity of the triangles yes the are similar by similarity ride rim therefore al upon dm equals ab upon de be cores corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional lets name this equation as two also we are given that triangle bc is similar to triangle de so the corresponding sides of triangle abc and the are proportional lets name this as equation tray substituting the valiof dc upon if as by upon de from equation three into equation on we get the ratio of areas of triangles bc and the ef equals by upon de multiplied by upon dm what should be the next step using equation to we can rr the above quasim in tons of perfect squares we get ratio of areas of triangle bc and the ef equals ab upon de hold square now using equation three we get arepanl result hence prove econeasily an the strand the proof divided into four parts let try our hands at some problems now problem one says that the areas of two similar triangles bc and de are sixteen square centimetres and forty nine square centimetres respectively if length of at is six pan three centimetres then you have to find the length of sa we have just studied at term which says that the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides therefore we can express the ratio of areas of triangles bc and de if as shown in the next step substitute the given vali se on making the left hand side perfect square and then simplifying further we obtain that the length of c is three point six anti meters it was quite easy right lets take look at another problem problem to says that in the diagram bc and d are straight lines b is pale to c d and ab is to bc is one is to two und to find the ratio of area of triangle ab to the area of triangle acid to solve this problem we shall first need to prove that triangles ab and ac d are similar how do we do so firstly anglb a is same as angles ab because they are common next angle ab is same as angle ac d because be is pl to cd and hence they are corresponding angles therefore triangle ab similar to triangle ac d by a similarity criterion now we have proven that triangles ab and ac d are similar we can find the ratio of their areas since it is given that ab upon bc is one upon two we can therefore find ab upon as where ac is the sum of ab and bc and hence the ratio is equal to one upon three note that ab is to bc equals one is to two this does not mean that ab is one centimetre and bc is to centimetres we can also have ab as for centimetres and bc as at centimetres what is given here is the ratio and not the actual lim so the ratio of the area of triangle ab to the bi of triangle ac d is the square of ab upon ac which is equal to one upon nine in ar nutshal ratio of the perimeters of the similar triangles is same as the ratio of their sides and ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides,"['next angle ab', 'hand side

Similar Polygons, you already have an idea about similar figures till now we have assumed the figures to be similar by appearance can you tell whether these pentagons are similar or not yes you are right they are similar if we rotate one of the pentagons or you can say flat one of them then they do not look similar by appearance but actually they are similar so how can you be showed that two figures are similar how can you express similarity of figures mathematically are there any rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar or not lets perform an activity which will helpers to wisulides similar figures and tear ova dots was at table directly under or lighted bull which it in the ceiling in your classroom cut up oligon say ab cd from are plain card boat and play set band to the ground between the bulb and the table with the help of your deter what do you see ar shadow of pentagon abc de is cast on the table ask your friend to mathe outline of the shadow as adash be dash cdash ddash dash can you cdat the shadow has the same shape as the the taut pentagonbut is larger in size so this shadow dash be dash cdash ddash dash is similar to the pentagon abc de and is called the enlargement or magnification of the pentagon abc de further adash lies on ray oa were or is the ball be dash lies on ray ob cdash lies on rose ddash lies on ray odd and dash lies on ray o now do you observe any correspondence between the pentagon and is shadow or any relation between the sides and angles not that dashcorrespons to wortexs a and we denote symbolically are shown here similarly bdashcorrespons to wortexsb and so on what about the sides and angles of both the figures is there any similarity between them we will find ances to these questions by measuring them use aprotracter to measure the angles of pentagon abc de we find that angle a equals one they degrees angle be equals ninety degrees angle equals one twenty degrees angled equals ninety degrees and angle equals one hundred entendegrees now on measuring the angles of pentagon adash bdash cdash ddash dash you will find that angle dash equals one thirty degrees which is equal to angle angle be dash equals ninety degrees which is equal to angle be and so on thus you can see that all the corresponding angles of both the figures are same now coming to the sites the sides of the pentagon a bc de are measured as for centimetres three centimetres five centimetres we point six centimetres and three centimetres the lengths of the corresponding sides of the shadow pentagon are eight centimetres six centimetres ten centimetres seven point to centimetres and six centimetres do you observe something the length of adash bdash is eight centimetres which is twice of length of ab as ab is four centimetres we can in for from above that adashbdash upon ab is eight upon for which is equal to two is it true for all the pars of corresponding sides less check be dash cdash upon bc is six upon three which is equal to two lit sec for another pair of sides to be sure cdashddash upon cd is ten upon five which is again equal to two similarly for other to peers the reshois two this emphasises that two polygons with the same number of sides are similar if one all the corresponding angles are equal and two all the corresponding sides are in the same resho this washow of the corresponding sides is referred to as the skafactor for the polygon how can you use scale factor in solving problems we will learn so by considering an example can you say whether the following correlatruls are similar or not clearly the corresponding angles of both the codrulatrals are equal also the ratio of the corresponding sides that is the scale factor is one point five for all the pairs so they are similar you have understood how to show that two figures are similar is as square similar to ar rectangle note that in both the figures corresponding angles are equal but their corresponding sides are not in the same ratio hence they are not similar so for similarity of polygons only one of the above two conditions is not sufficient both have to be satisfied thus transitive property holds true for similarity of polygons it means ive von polygon is similar to another polygon and this second polygon is similar to he third polygon then the first polygon is similar to the third polygon don't worry its simple when you visualize it consider two similar quadrilates bc d and pecuares now if we take another quadrilateral j k elem which is similar to pecuares then we have to show that bc d similar to j k elem clearly the corresponding angles are equal coming to the sites the ratio of porresponding sites is also same so quadrilaterals bc d and j k elm are also similar so the transitive property

Similarity of Triangles, similarity of triangles how can we say two triangles are similar two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal or their corresponding sides are in the same ratio or proportion not that if corresponding angles of two triangles are equal then they are known as equally angular triangles let us find out whether these two triangles triangle bc and triangle bu are are similar or not here we see angle is equal to angle be angle b is equal to angle cu and angles is equal to angle are now let us measure the sides of the triangles bc equal to two sentimenters and bu is equal to four sentimenters therefore be upon peas equal to one upon two bc is equal to three sentimenters and are is equal to six sentimenters therefore bc upon are is equal to one upon to as equal to four sentimenters and be re is equal to eight sentimenters therefore ac upon be are is equal to one upon two so their corresponding sides are in the same ratio therefore we se triangles bc and bu are satisfies both the conditions of similarity thus triangle bc and triangle bu are are similar,"['same ratio', 'corresponding', 'triangles', 'angle', 'equal']"
Similarity vs Congruency, have you ever thought about what makes to things similar in every day conversation the word similar is just another way of describing things that are alike let start by looking at some pairs of everyday object we can probably describe each of these pars as being similar in some or other wape it can be based on their colour function species shape et cetera but when it comes to geometry similarity has got are specific meaning lets go ahead and explothat further by looking at the pair of shoes observe that the lases being different in cole both shoes have the same shape even when we enlargtare reduce either of them they are still the same shape this is also true when we change the orientation by rotating them thus we say that two figures are similar geometrically when they have the same shape we will work upon some geometrical shapes now here we have triangles ex wait and bc observe that triangle bc is just the scale down version of triangle ex vi sad moreover when vertex ex coin sides with vertex at the two pairs of corresponding sides also coin side and similarly if the vertices why and said coin side with vertices be and see respectively the two pairs of corresponding sides also coin side so the triangles ex vi said and bc are similar as they are of same shape we can also conclude that they are not congruent can you guess why what is the difference between similarity and congruent se can ar figure be both similar and congruent to another figur if triangles ex vi said and ab se are of the same size as well then all the vertices of both the triangles coin side hence the triangles are congruent both similar and congruent figures have the same shape but congruent figures also have the same sides thus two figures are said to be similar if they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size we will now move ahead to check out are few more examples am ions to eight pits are for thinner she chooses and eighteen inch peda and are fourteen in pit sa are these congruent you already know that also cal with the same ridia are congruent here the diameter of both pets are as different and hence the radii so they are not congruent but you can see that they are similar as they are of same shape therefore also cles are similar can you think of some other similar geometrical shapes what abaltsquares and equilateral triangles two are mosquares of different sides are similar but not congruent as they have the same shape but not the same size two or more equilatal triangles of different sides are similar but not congruent so we can say that all congruent figures are similar but the similar figures need not be congruent there is of course the possibility of situation we two figures are neither similar nor congruent to each other can you imagine what that might look like surely you can answer this for example and equilatral triangle and are right triangle are neither similar nor congruent as they have neither the same shape nor the same size,"['other similar geometrical', 'more equilatal triangles', 'same sides', 'similar figures', 'coin sides', 'triangles coin', 'similar', 'same', 'inch peda', 'ar figure', 'geometry similarity', 'et cetera', 'everyday object', 'day conversation', 'sides', 'triangles', 'triangle', 'more', 'coin', 'meaning', 'function', 'geometrical', 'figures', 'other', 'pit', 'similarity']"
Solving Equations Reducible to Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables, sand wants to go for or holiday and the destination he has chosen is seven hundred sixty calometers away from his home his friend suggest two options to travel this distans in the first option we must take to three or one hundred sixty caloeters and up as for the remaining distans them it will take him at hours to reaches destinationthe second option and walls covered two hundred forty glometers by three and the remaining by bus it will take might hours and tell man as to reach is destination same wants to know the speed of the que and the bus separately can you help some let this bead of the train by ex culometes bar our and the speed of the bus be yilometers for our since time equals this tons upon speed so for option one we get the equation one hundred sixty upon ex plus six hundred upon by equals aid dividing at by of the equation by eight we get quit the upon plus seventy fine upon by equals one lets name this equation as one similarly for the second option we get the equation to hundred forty upon ex plus by hundred twenty upon equals forty one upon five lets name this equation as two can you solve these equations to find the require speeds you have already learnt to solve sametanios linear equations but our these equations ln no we is they are not in the form ex plus be iv plus these equal to zero can you think of away cone them in two linear form let us we write the given pair of equations as shown here if we substitute one upon ex as m and one upon why as nm in equations three and for we get twenty m plus seventy five nm equals one lets name the equation as five and two hundred forty m plus iv hundred twenty nm equals forty one upon five name this equation as six one multiplying equation be by twelve we get equation seven on solving equations six and seven we get mequals one upon one hundred and mequals uone upon eight you know that m equals one upon ex nd than equals one upon five no substitute the values of m and nm to get ex equals at and why equals one hundred therefore the tet of the quanaseihteculometers or our and the speed of up as is one hundred gulometers for our in this way such equations can be solved by some ease steps step one we at new variables by making suitable substitutions step two substitute these new variables in the given non

find the required unsa now lets queue solve question observe these equations on replacing one upon ex be nm and one upon iv by nm what new equations will you get you will get one upon to m plus one upon three nm equals two m one upon three mplus on upon two m equals thirteen upon six on solving these two equations we get mequals two and equals three now requassingm and nd by their ariginal values we get one upon ex equals two and one upon why equals three on solving the two equations we get its equals one upon two and by equals one upon three therefore one upon two one upon three is the solution of the given analtanias equations let us leak at another pair of equations can you solve them since these equations are non linear so we need to convert them into linear equations first let us we write the given pair of equations as shown here which expressions as we replace the node to convertm into linear equation lets take one upon plus why equal to m and one upon ex one as why equal to m on substituting these values in the given equations we get them m plus to m equals for and fifteen m by nos five m equals negative to lets name them as equations one and two now on multiplying equation one by five and equation to by two we get equations three and for respectively solving for m and we get am equals one upon five and equals one but we have taken m as one upon ex plus vi and as one upon ex minus iv on substituting the values of m and nm and simplifying further we get ex plus iv equals five and ex minus vi equals one on solving these equations we get ex equals three and equals two therefore two three is the required solution of the given pair of simultaneous equations thus such pairs of equations which are not linear but can be reduced to linear form are solved by

Acceleration due to Gravity and its Variation, acceleration due to gravity and its variation why does an apple thrown upwards come down why does the speed of the appllingcrees as it comes down it is because the earth attracts all the objects towards it centre with the folds of gravit here or is the centre of the earth and are is the radius of the earth acceleration is produced in the objects which fall freely towards the earth this acceleration of freely falling bodies is cold acceleration due to gravity it is denoted by g its mean value on the odsrfaces nine point be dt meter per second square the value of g is taken to be positive when an object falls downward and negative when it mols upward against the old gravity for this very reason green falls in the downward direction when an apple is thrown upward it goes in ar direction opposite to the direction of the folds of gravity therefore it decelerat or slows down however when an apple falls down it moves in the same direction as that of the folds of gravity therefore it accelerates tvariation in the value of g with high consider apoint at height above the old surface the value of acceleration due to the gravity g dash at point b is less than that at the surface of the earth it is because the effective radius for this point becomes are flask hence with an increase in height the value of g decreases for example at the se level gdashes nine point date met per second square at height of at point at chilometer on the moundeveres gases nine point eight go meter per second square and for communication satellite twenty five thousand seven hundred chilometer above the old surface gdashes go point to to fit meter per second square only this shows that axilaration due to gravity queries with hide let us now find the axilaration due to gravity at the depth consider apoint jw at the de below the earth surface though the effective radius for this point decreases which should have caused an increase in the value of g however the effective mass for this point also decreases the combined effect of decrease in the effective radius and mass of the or with absent are degrees in the value of g therefore at the de of two point five chilometer inside cold point gdash is nine point seven meter per second square while on the side elevelometer below gas decreases to nine point sets meter per second square the value of g increases as one moves from the greater towards the pole this is because the earth is not of perfect square it is flattened at the poles the equatorial radiaces twenty one hilometer greater than the radius at the poles due to this difference in the radius the value of g at the poles is greater than that at the equate the rotational motion of the earth also affects the value of on the old surface therefore the value of gdash varies on moving from the equator to the poles,"['cold point gdash', 'gravity g', 'point', 'surface gdashes', 'direction', 'level gdashes', 'rotational motion', 'hilometer greater', 'equatorial radiaces', 'combined effect', 'communication satellite', 'moundeveres gases', 'mean value', 'cold acceleration', 'meter', 'g', 'gravity', 'effective', 'consider', 'reason', 'square', 'surface', 'gdash', 'greater', 'value', 'acceleration']"

Buoyancy, as it gate you might have tried inserting at closed empty plastic bottle into a bucket of water what happens when you release the bottle inside the water yes you are absolutely correct the bottle floats on the surface of water let us take a little deeper into the situation to understand the reason behind this we already know that gravity pots the bottle in the downward direction with the force equal to the weight of the bottle if the only force acting on the bottle was its weight the bottle would have moved downward but that is not the case instead as we all might have experience the bottle comes up at the surface of water this means that there must be ar force acting on the bottle in an upward direction this upward force exerted by water on the bottle is for bond force in fact all objects experience aboind force when the are partially are fully immersed in ar fluid now let us take two objects are cork and an iron nail of equal weight let us now put them both in a bucket of water what do you see you can see that the cork floats while the iron nail sinks let us analyse why this happens the cork and the iron nail are pulled downwards with the same force since they have the same weight but the cork floats while the iron nail sinks this means that the bond force on the cork must be more than the bond force on the nail this happens because the density of the cork is less than the density of water whereas the density of the iron nail is more than the density of water there for objects that have less idensity than the density of of fluid will float on the surface of the fluid and objects that have more density than the density of ar fluid will sink in the fluid let us now perform an activity to find the magnitude of the boined force acting on an object emerst partially or fully in aflui the materials required for this activity are as spring balance are bucket filled three forts with water and at cubotal iron block with fork first and the cuboid an iron block on to the spring balance and no down its true weight now slowly immerse this cuboidal iron log into the water in the bucket you will obser that as the iron block goes inside the marker of this spring balance moves up when the iron block is completely immersed in water the spring balance shows the apparent weight of the cuboidal iron block in the water but why does this happen this happens because of the borne force that pushes the block up word due to weights the net downward weight of the iron block decreases the difference in the true weight of the iron block in air and apparent weight in water gives the magnitude of the bond force acting over it you will be amazed to know that its the born force that has the mightyships sail over the ocean so are learning through this animation can be summarised as follows,"['aboind force', 'ar force', 'upward force', 'force', 'iron nail', 'empty plastic bottle', 'downward weight', 'iron', 'downward direction', 'weight', 'spring balance', 'object emerst', 'more density', 'less idensity', 'little deeper', 'upward direction', 'downward', 'bottle', 'nail', 'ar', 'less', 'density', 'more']"

Concentration, a glass of case is something that we all enjoy drinking on a hot day scourge is the concentrated fro jute which can be consumed by adding water on adding water the concentrated true use gets diluted based on the concentration as solution can be classified as concentrated and diluted let us first learn about concentration and the various ways to express as solutions concentration asolution consists of as solvent and as solute dissolved in the solvent oncolution may contain as small amount of solute were as another solution may contain a large amount of solute the amount of solute present in a given volume of solution is called its concentration as solution with as mol amount of solute is said to have ar low concentration it is referred to as a diluted sluion on the other hand as solution containing a large amount of solute is said to be of high concentration it is known as a concentrated slution can we dissolve as mutsolute in aparticular solution as we want the answer is no after as certain amount of solute has been dissolved no additional solute can be dissolved as solution at a particular temperature such as solution is known as as saturated solution the amount of solute in as saturated solution at a given temperation is called its solubilitie it is the maximum amount of solute that as solvent can dissolved as solutions concentration is the amount of solute present in a given volume of solution it can be expressed in avarity of rates let us learn about some of the methods for expressing the concentration of solution in general the concentration of as solution can be expressed as mass of solute divided by mass of solvent or solution have ever notice the symbols blue by by we and we by we ondthe labls of many liquid medicens the concentration of solution is often expressed as mass by mass percentage by mass by volume percentage by we and volume by volume percentage we by we let us know about them one by one the mass percentage of as solution is denoted by the symbol by blue it is generally used in the case of as solid solute dissolved in aliquid solvent it is expressed as the mass of solute in grounds divided by the ms of solution in grounds then multiplied by hundred to get ar percentage the ms percentage of as solute is thus the amount of solute in grounds present in one hundred grounds of solution let us on is tan this with an example at ten person weight by wait accutsugar solution means that the area ten groups of sugar in one hundred grounds of solution here one hundred grounds of solution contain ten grounds of sugar and the remaining ninety grounds is the solvent water let us solve anamericol here for abettar understanding as solution contains twenty grounds of solume chloride in three hundred grams of water calculate the concentration in terms of mass by mass percentage of the solution given that mass of solumecluride is twenty grounds mass of water is three hundred grounds we know that mass of solution is equal to mass of solute as mass of solvent here solumeclurie is as solute and water is as solvent therefore mass of solution is equal to mass of solumecluride plasmass of water and is equated three hundred twenty grounds putting the value in the vomula mentioned below on calculating we get six point to five per cent the concentration of as solid solute is also expressed as mass by volume percentage of solution it is denoted by the symbol by we the mass by volume percentage is given as the mass of solute in grounds divided by the volume of solution in mililiters then multiplied by hundred to get ar percentage mass by volume percentae prepresents the mass of solute in grounds dissolved in hundred milli litres of solution for example one point and weight by volume solumecurite solution contains one point one grounds of solumeluride in one hundred milli ters of solumeclurite solution let us now learn about the volume percentage of or solution when liquid solute is dissolved in an liquid solvent the volume percentage of the solution is used to express the concentration of the solution volume percentage is denoltued by the symbol we by we it is calculated by dividing the volume of solute in mililaters but the volume of solution in mililaters and multiplying the result by hundred to get ar percentage assolutions volume percentage thus represents the volume of solute in mililaters present in hundred mililiters of solution at twenty percent volume by volume solution of alcohol for example means that twenty milli litres of alcohol is present in hundred mililiters of solution the percentage method is he common way of expressing the concentration of solution it is commonly used in the chemical industry to express the concentration of chemical solutions lets recall what we have learned so far the concentration of solution is denoted by the terms concentrated and diluted a solutions concentration is the amount of solute present in a given volume of solution the

Discovery of proton using anode ray tube, from the cathode ray experiment it was discovered that the electrons are the base constituents of all the atoms we all know that and atom is electrically neutral therefore it should have some positively charged particus to neutralise the negative charge of the electrons in eighteen eighty six mol stain experimentally prove the existence of positive charge along with the negative charge in the matter the performed discharge tube experiment and discovered that in addition to the cathode rays ane bind iv rays was also found behind the cathode he conducted the discharge tube experiment by passing the electricity at high bold days through of gas at low pressure in discharge tube fitted with the perforated cathode are discharge tube with the long glass tube containing electrodes at each end cathode is the negatively charged electrode and anode is the positively charged electrode the electrodes are connected to aa sols the to behind the perforated cathode is coated with the phospho like sing so pit so that the invisibly emited radiation can tides with sepelide the electrical discharge through the cases the place only when the pressure inside the tube is very low and the potential difference between the electrodes is very high now the question arises that why are we keeping the low pressure inside the discharge tube when the gas atoms in the discharge tube are at the atmospheric pressure they collide with the electrons and thereby prevent them from reaching the anode as no electrons reach the anode no current plots through the discharge tube when the gas atoms are at very low pressure of few gas atoms are present in the discharge tube hence there is no hindrans in the movement of the electrons and therefore the gas tan at electricity when high voltage is applied between the electrodes apart from the usual cathode rays emerging from the perfrations you will say that some rays are coming from the side of the anal as were these rays of the passing through the perforated cathode strike the sing sulphide coding and or red glow is observed on the class wall these rays are part as the anode rays the cause they originate from the anode these rays are also cord as the canal rays because they pass through the canals that is the holes in the cathode these rays travel in the direction opposite to that of the cathode rays let us study about the origin of the anal rays we know that the cathode rays consist of or stream of electrons when high volt at is applied these electrons move towards the anode with the very high speed when these fast moving electrons strike the gaseous atoms they knock of the electrons this results in the formation of the positively charged ions these positively charged ions move towards the perfrated cathode and constitute the beam of the anode rays coming through the holes of the cathode now let us this di some of the properties of the anode rays the anode rays travel in as tray line when an object is rays in the part of the anode rays are sharp shadow is produced on the glass wall the anode rays are made up of material particles if we like pale while is placed in the path of the anode rays the wheel begins to rotate the anode rays carry positive charge when an electric field is applied the and rays are deflected towards the negative played of the electric field this shows that the charged particles in the anode rays carry positive charge and therefore the anode rays are also called as positive rays when the magnetic field is applied by bringing the south pole of ar magnet near the discharge tube the anode rays are deflected towards the magnet on reversing the magnet we observe that the rays are deflected in the opposite direction it shows that the anode rays carry positive charge the properties of the anode rays depend upon the nature of the gas taken in the discharge tube the mouth of the particles that constitutes the anode rays is different for different gases taken in the discharge tube when hydrogen gas is taken in the discharge tube lightest positive ions called protons are produced or proton is produced when one electron is removed from the hydrogen atom and itersabout when housant eight hundred body times massive than an electron after studying the various properties of the and rays it is clear that the anode rays are made up

Distillation, when we add salt to water it gets completely dissolved in it similarly acetone forms at clear solution when mixed with water both these mixtures have components that are completely soluble with each other we are familiar with the evaporation process to separate salt from ar mixture of salt and water but how can we obtain acetone from the acetone water mixture can we use the same process to separate acetone from water to answer these questions we are going to look at an interesting technique known as distillation let us first understand the signs behind this proceeds distillation is as simple technique that aims at separating two miscible components of ar mixture based on their boiling points the principle involves heating a mixture of to substances one of which has ar lower boiling point and can vaporises easy late this substance is called the volatile substance the other has ar higher boiling point and is called less volatile on non volatile when the mixture is heated the volatile substance heats up first and forms vapours these vapours cool down to form upper liquid the liquid thus obtained is called the distillate and can be separated from another substance before we start the scribing the process let us first familiarise with the apparatus used in this technique this set up comprises of a big round votom distillation flask in which the mixture is to be heated it is cart from the top side to prevent the mixture from coming out the flask is kept on support stand ar bunsen burner is used to heat the mixture next we use of water condenser it is are long glass tube surrounded by ar wider glass tube having an inletand an outlet for water cold water circulates in through the outer tube of the condenser it takes survey the heat of the vapour while passing through the inner tube of condenser there is an outlet for water to go out apoenical flask is used at the end to collect the liquid let us formed in the condensate let us not try to understand the distillation of acetone water mixture bold the mixture of acetone and water in the distillation flask put an laboratory thermometer with the cork attach to it and close the distillation flask let us start are running supply of cold water through the condenser now our set up is complete we now heat the mixture by putting the bunsen burner on from low flame to high flame as the mixture starts to heat the thermometer reading measures fifty six degree celsius when we see vapours getting form these vapours can be seen travelling upwards from theoretical knowledge we can form that this temperature is the boiling point of acetone at this temperature acetone turns into the vapostate the acitone vapours now travel from the distillation flask to words the water condenser the water supply cools down the vaprs to form liquid acetone which gets collected in the conical flask in this way acetone get separated from water do you know there are several important applications of distillation as well lets this stu some in patan fans this tillation is used in food processing to produce distilled beverages on ar last scale distillation is used in petroleum refinaries and natural gas processing plans it is also used to separate the mixture of organic solvents like heater and toluene hexane and toluene chloroform and aniline and so on let us summarise what we have learned so far,"['acetone water mixture', 'round votom distillation flask', 'liquid acetone', 'distillation flask', 'glass tube', 'ar mixture', 'gas processing', 'ar bunsen', 'acetone', 'water', 'boiling', 'petroleum refinaries', 'patan fans', 'acitone vapours', 'theoretical knowledge', 'degree celsius', 'top side', 'miscible components', 'clear solution', 'distillation', 'ar', 'processing', 'tube', 'flask', 'toluene', 'important', 'flame', 'volatile', 'technique', 'process', 'mixture', 'liquid', 'bunsen', 'vapours', 'components']"

Formation of Clouds and Rain, what you notice whenutakea water water out from the refrigerat and keep it on etapour for some time yes we observe water droplets on the surface of the bottle and on the table around the base of the bottle do you know why this happens well this occurs because water vapours present in the air surrounding the bottle come into contact with the bottle lose energy and can word into liquid state that is droplets isn it interesting to know that this process of conversion of water vapour in to water droplets plays acute role in influence climatic changes that formation of clouds in rain let us perform an activity to have ar better inside into the faces that in plants climatic changes petiustoquied for this activity in close an empty plastic bottle water and an lighted incentives first take an anti bottle like the won in with water is generally sols then or approximately five to ten milli leades of water in it and close the cap tightly now state the bottle and placed in the sun for ten minutes well take lighted in centage open the cap of the bottle and let some smoke of the insensiti and at the bottle quickly close the bottle cap tightly then press the bottle between your hands and crushed that for afew seconds and then release the bottle repeat the process of pressing and crushing this to the observations answer some simple questions when did you observe that the air inside the bottle became fake and when did it disappear well when the bottle containing water is cat in the sun the water inside evaporates and the air inside the water bottle that saturated with the water vaprs thereafter when the bottle is pressed the pressure in the bottle increases and the air at pants and cools as the smoke of incense texanters into the bottle the smoke particus act as nuclei on with the water vapours tan tens and take the shape of tiny droplets when the pressure in the bottle is released that is when the pressure decreases the air in it tends for when the bottle is at van press the fog disappears can you geswyther smoke disappears well it is because the water vapours formed by the condensation due to high pressure fall down and accumulate as water at the bottom of the bottle now any answer what might happen is we perform this experiment without the smoke from the in centage when the experiment is performed without smoke in the bottle forty ar in the bottle will not be observed it ages because the smoke part cars that act as nuclei for water vapours to can tends will be atsins whalitating the above experiment on allotted can ystate watt would happen when the irwith high water vaper potent goes from aretion of high pressure that is the sea to region of low pressure that is the land yes this would result in condensation of water vapours into liquid bottle let is now relate this experiment to the phenomenon of evaporation and condensation taking place in nature during day time the solar radiations heater the water bottles as it result water turns into water vapour by the process of evaporation these water vapours rise into the air various biological activities such as transpiration by the plants also contribute to the water vapour in the atmosphere during the day the air also gets heated up and so the hot air rises along with the water vapour as this water moves up it expands and cools this cooling late to the condensation of the water vapour present in the air into tiny water droplets now you might be vanturing what facilitates this condensation process in the atmosphere well in the atmosphere the dust and other as pen at but cars act like new pleas around which the top lets found the celetion of these droplets leads to the formation of clouds when the cut become beaker and heavier precipitation aces do you know what precipitation is yes precipitation is any protect of the condensation of atmospheric water vapours that falls on the earth under the gravitation of bold from the clouds it is usually in the form of rain however then the atmospheric temprature is very low precipitation aces in the form of fleet cal or snow on in our country rainfall mainly occurs from tune to september if you ever wondered what determines the rainfall pattern across ar contra is it constant in all the regions across the country well the rainfall patterns are determined by the prevailing win patents during the rainy season in in dia the clouds move with the vents blowing from the south west direction and or fall south west mornsoon on the other hand during the member and december the rain occurs as a result of the movement of the clouds along with the vents blowing from the eastern side and are known as north east man soon moreover the depression in the way of pen gall also leads to rainfall in surmareas depression are low pressure areas in the atmosphere where air moves up in as spiral form we generally notice that rainfall is accompanied by thunder and lightning but does this always happen well now not of was however rainfall during the monson season in india is usually accompanied with thunder and lightning now observe the given data of the rainfall pattern in tally from the given data we can observe that maximum precipitation to place in the months of july august and september gene we call the name of the instrument that is used to measure rainfall yes rainfall is measured by arraingages it is an instrument which is used to measure the amount of precipitation in a given time per unit arido you know that we can make a rain gauge using some common items found in our homes let us construct one the materials to quiet for constructing ar rain gauge are acrostic bottom a pair of scissors some pebbles matter duct tape water first cut the top of the bottle using a pair of scissors well for some pebbles in the bottom to even out the bottom of the bottle remove the kept from the top cut part of the bottom and place it upside down that is in the form of funnel on the bottom of the bottle using at tape securetwo parts of the bottle such that no gap is present between the two pieces now for some water till the level of pebbles from the top of pebble let pace he long vertical tape using amarker mark of labors at half sendingta distances make sure to mark the bottom label as siro now place this rain gauge on aplatground surface let the rain water fall down into the bottom and check the gate after twenty four hours the label corresponding to the water level in the bottle determines the amount of rainfall in that region to get a reliable reading the gate must not be placed under at tree or roof range pipes this in shows that extra water is not collected also the gate must be placed away from any obstacle now let us recapitulate the main conceals,"['water water',

Free Fall, you must have heard the name of of famous sichactress surisecnuton who explained that it is not only the earth which attracts an apple and the moon and it is not only the sun which attracts every planet rather every object in this universe attracts every other object but if one of the to attracting objects is base may the earth then it is cold gravityt the north for of forts gravity is due to its heavy mass the attraction of objects towards the earth is noticeable but the reverse to snobtrue due to the heavy mass of earth the object that moves under the influence all the force of gravity alone is factory falling freely to understand this more clearly let to small activity take of ball and hold it in your hand can you think which forces are acting on the ball as the force of gravity due to the earth acts on eaten every object so when you were holding the ball in your hand the ball was experience in this force but it was balanced by force that you were blind on it in the opposite direction as the result the ball remains in your hand now released the ball what are the forces acting on the ball after you released it once the ball is released from the hand the only for that acts on it is the gravitation of force of the earth due to hit the ball falls down so whenever an object moves under the influence of the force of gravity alone it is that to be falling freely hence the ball released is under the state of free fall let for again the self the the fall on of the ball there is no jhange in the direction of motion of the ball but its initial velocity is zero and it goes on increasing due to gravitation of pull of the earth it means acceleration is produced when it falls freely this acceleration is called excelration due to gravity denoted by ge now the question that iris is is whether the acceleration is same for every object when the experience the force of gravity no night objects accelerate slower than heavy objects lets understand this through as can be activity hold the piece of paper in your one hand and the ball in the other hand now drop them simultaneously from the same height above the level surface what do you observe the acceleration of ball is so noticeable and it is greater than the acceleration of paper this is due to the reason that during free fall the frictional force due to are opposes the motion of the objects which is more for light objects but if you crumble the same pace of paper and the shape of of ball and then release it from the height its exelaration is also noticeable as that of ball do not is the free fall of objects eras pective of their masses and the arises tons sin tests performed an experiment in vacuum by taking feather and is stone the prove that when both are less simultaneously from the same height the reach the surface in the same time gallilio also prove that acelaration of objects falling freely towards the earth this not the pen the bother mass he performed an experiment in around fifty ninety in the italian city of fecal what he did is it took two stones of the front masses and dropped both of them simultaneously from the leaning tower of phase he notice that the stones re the ground in the same time for if freely falling object the velocity on creating the earth and the and tan for it can be calculated by using new tens equations of motion lets understand the significance of these equations when an object is the lot to fall freely from height its any show velocity years zero when an object falls vertically downwards its velocity goes on increasing so de is falsitect when an object is thrown botically upwards its velocity goes on decreasing so ge is negative at the highest point final velocity we of the object is zero so it falls with you equals to zero and ge equals to nine point eight metre per second square,"['point final velocity', 'same time', 'famous sichactress surisecnuton', 'heavy objects', 'tons sin', 'heavy mass', 'force due', 'small activity', 'other object', 'velocity', 'second square', 'front masses', 'italian city', 'level surface', 'free fall', 'opposite direction', 'forts gravity', 'cold gravityt', 'same', 'gravity due', 'objects', 'tens', 'other', 'activity', 'force', 'mass', 'point', 'surface', 'masses', 'direction', 'fall', 'gravity', 'due', 'object']"

Momentum, you must have experience that when or heavy truck is standing on the road then you do not far to cross the road however when the same truck is in motion even with small velocity you do not cross the road until the moving truck pass is by when the truck is at rest we do not have any far of its striking us but when it is in motion even with small velocity it might ingure as severely if we accidentally come into its part similarly when apasmoving ball comes to words you while playing the game of cricket you not down to prevent any injury to your body in the case of ar heavy tropmoving which small velocity or as small ball moving very fast there is the common property which has the capability to injure as upon striking this physical property which develops due to the combination of mass and velocity of the object cos termed momentum by newton mathematically the momentum of an object is contified as the product of its mass and its velocity at any moment of time momentum has both direction and magnitude its direction is the same as that of velocity we thus momentum is of vector quantity the sa unit of momentum is kilogram metre per second while in the sides system it is grams intimate per second they are or two physical quantities that directly affect the momentum of an object first is its mass and second is its wilosity suppose two crs one of blue colour and another of red colour have same mass say one thousand kilogram or moving with the velocity of five metre per second and twenty meet per second respectively can you gets which car will have more momentum yes it is the red card as both cars have the same mass but the red car has more velocity as compared to the blue card to see the effect of momentum produced by these cars let us collide pocars with walls ahead you will observe that the red car will do the maximum damage to the wall as compared to the blue car as it has more momentum as compared to the blue card test on the above observations it can be concluded that for two objects of the same mass em the more is the velocity of eloject more will be its momentum that is the momentum by is directly proposinal to velocity we of an object this relation can be graphically shown as similarly for two objects having constant velocity but different masses the momentum will be more for the heavier object that is pea is directly proportional to ms mm of an object this relation can be graphically shown as when an unbalanced force acts on an object it changes its wilosity thereby its momentum for example when excelleratur of the car is pushed then the engine applies the unbalanced force on wheels which causes it to speed up thus leading to increase in its momentum similarly when break is applied to slow down or stop or moving car then engine applies an unbalanced force on the wheels and cars lose down and eventually stops thus leading to are decrease in the momentum thus it can be concluded that to change the momentum of an object an unbalanced force is required apart from the magnitude of the unbalanced force the time for which the unbalanced force acts also plays an important role in the change of momentum of an object that is consider ar situation in which ar car with the dead battery is to be pushed along as straight road to give it as small speed which is sufficient to start its engine if one or two persons give as sudden push unbalanced force to it it hardly starts but he continuous push over some time results in agradual motion of the car to this speed which is sufficient to start the engine it means that the change of momentum of the car is not only determined by the magnitude of the force but also by the time during which the force is exerted,"['push unbalanced force', 'small velocity', 'more velocity', 'heavy truck', 'ar heavy', 'same truck', 'more momentum', 'physical property', 'ar car', 'blue card', 'red card', 'unbalanced force', 'blue car', 'red car', 'time momentum', 'maximum damage', 'grams intimate', 'sides system', 'kilogram metre', 'sa unit', 'vector quantity', 'small', 'velocity', 'truck', 'more', 'ar', 'physical', 'property', 'car', 'force', 'push', 'red', 'blue', 'time', 'same', 'momentum', 'metre', 'kilogram', 'object', 'motion', 'road']"
Newton's Third Law of Motion, newtons heard law of motion it states that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and the action reaction pushes act on different bodies when person tries to jump from the boat on to the bank the boat gets pushed in the backward direction the action of the person in the forward direction causes the boat to move back the boy on the scale for it pushes the wall and the wall in turn pushes him in the backward direction these two examples show that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction also it can be seen that the action and reaction forces are acting on different bodies in ar rocket the gas is produced by the burning of milrushon at very high speed an equal and opposite reaction caused by these exhaust gases pushes the rocket upwards at high speed while swimming the swimmer pushes the water backwards with his arms and legs an equal and opposite reaction applied by the water pushes the swimmer forward,"['reaction', 'backward direction', 'exhaust gases', 'high speed', 'ar rocket', 'different bodies', 'direction', 'rocket']"
Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation, you must be aware of the fact that gravity was discovered by ar famous this is is are isactnuten when he saw an apple falling from the tree the earth attracts the falling apple but does the apple attract the year yes at coding to newtons her law of motion the apple does attract the year then vi can we notesjecttraction of earth towards the apple because according to the second law of motion for at given for acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of an object the mass of an apple is negligibly small compared to that of the earth so we do not see the earth movntowards the apple the on the strand this in detail as we know that the exceleration teduce in an object due to gravitational pull obtheeart on it is nine point at meter per second square as this acceleration is very large we can see the object falling towards the earth tut when the gravitational pull of is seen radius as one liter of mass six into ten to the pave twenty four kilogram the acceleration produced in the ear is one point six three into ten to the pavabanas twenty for metre per second square as this valley of atleration is to small so we can of see the earth moving towards the falling object on the basis of of objections you must have on the to that to wide ear is not most towards the moon or all the planets in our solar system go round the sun there ex this up force between the earth and the moon and between the fan and the planets from the above facts net in an tied that not only does the ear attract and apple and the moon but all objects in the universe attract each other this force of attraction between objects is called the gravitational for the gravitational force is always attractive and the tens only on the masses and vol and the this tens between them considering this surisacnution propose this gravitational law which tentative object in this universe attracts every other object with the force that acts along ar line joining their enters of mass the force is are lyte posnal to the father of their masses and inversely propose ones to the square of distance between them from newtons third law of motion the made use of force is same on each object here the is called universal gravitational constant which does no depend on the mass of the two attracting objects new tens law of gravitation is applicable to all the objects in is universe having mass so this law is called universal law of gravitation let us now find the gravitational force between the light objects and the heavy objects suppose two objects each of mass one ulogra are sepreted by at this tens of one meter the gravitational force of attraction they is ecor to dee von and to the videdby or square or ex ecor to get multiply by one ulogram into one culogran divided by one meter square which implies is equal to gain hence universal gravitational constant is one merry tally equal to the gravitational force of attraction between two objects at of unit mass tet to one metre apart from each other the valley often for an by an recravinition by using as sense valent this extremely small value indicates that for every pair of two objects exert gravitational pull on each other still they cannot move towrds each other the cause this gravitational pull is to we to overcome the frictional force between the objects and the ground let us now calculate the gravitational force when elite object has mass of one kilogram while the heavy one is earth the mass of the earth is six into ten to the pave twenty four kilogram and its radius is six point for into ten to the pave six meter the gravitational force of attraction between the big and the object is nine point newton this shows that earth exerts or gravitational force of nine point at newton on an object of mass one tea which is mucilabter compared to the force when for the objects are liter this is the reason that when an object is fro framahaitit falls towards the earth now suppose for the objects sobheavy one is the earth while other is the moon the mass of the moon is seven point for into ten to the pave twenty to to to grass and tract of earth is six into ten to the pave twenty four clogrand the this tens between them is three point at for into ten to the pave eight meter the gravitational force between earth and moon is two points zero and into ten to th pave twenty newton which is very large it is this gravitational force exerted by the earth on the moon which makes the moon to revolve around the but divided newton assume in volt square dependence on distant in his law of gravitation he was helped by kept us heart la let see how newton found that the lidicity of orbits of planets around the sun is small therefore orbits of the planets can be taken more or less as circular orbits the force required to maintain the planet in circular orbit is the centripetal for if newton postulated that this force is provided by the plavitational pull of sun on the planet if m is the mass of the planet moving with the speed we in a circular orbit of radius our around the sun then the centripetal force is equal to gravitational cal if that is if equals to mve square divided by or if th is the time period of revolution of the planet is equal to time taken by planet to complete one revolution tent equals to distance covered in on revolution divided by sp is equal to two by or divided by we or we is equal to two by or divided by th equating this value in above equation we get if equals to min to two by our divided by the square divided by our so if equals

square according to kept us heard law of planetary motion the square divided by our you equals to aconstant and as for by square mequals to ar constant for planet hence if equals to constant divided by our square our if is inversely proportional to our square that is gravitational force between the sun and the planet our inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers

NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Third Law of Motion, we all walk daily to do our work but what enables us to wk yes it is the force which never acts alone in nature lets understand this to walk on the ground we push the ground backwards with our foot as he reaction the ground pushes our foot forward with the same force it is this forward reaction force of the ground that enables us to walk forward whereas action force of foot on the ground is backward both the action and reaction forces re equal in magnitude but opposite in direction this is an of the examples of newtons third law of motion which states that to every action there is always an equal and of the reaction this understand some more examples based on the log when a government fires he bullet from ar gun the gun recoils that is the gun moves words through a small distance this is because on firing the gun exerts some force on the bullet in the forward direction which is an action force in turn the bullet exrts and equal force on the gun backward direction which is ar reaction force the distance moved by the gun is smaller because the gun is much heavier than the bullet hence action and reaction forces may not produce axileration of equal magnitude as swimmer while trying to swim push is the water backward with his hands and feet this is the action false in turn water pushes the swim ar forward with the same force this is the reaction face suppose a sailor is in he boat at rest near or river bank when the sailor jumps from the boat to the river bank the boat is pushed away from the bank this happens due to equal forces of action and reaction during the launch of us at light through or rocket the few that burns appears in the form of hot and highly compressed gases these gases escape through ar nozzle in the gun word direction which is an action force as a reaction the rocket moves of word with the same fare action and reaction force can also be visualised through as simple activity for which materials required are aclamstand appiece of thread of around three feet a good quality test up bunsen burner and acok to fit at the mouth of the test up pore as small amount of water in the test cube and close its mouth with the stop co with the help of the string suspend the test cube horizontally on the clamp stand allow the flame of the bunsen burner placed below the test up until water wirises and the cork blows out as the cork blows out to the right so this is an action force an equal reaction force recoils the test up in the direction opposite to the direction of the cork as the cork is lighter than the testiube they are for excellaration produced in the cork is more than the axileration of the testiube hence the velocity of cork is more than the velocity of the testiube,"['ar reaction force', 'equal reaction force', 'reaction force', 'action force', 'equal force', 'ar gun', 'quality test', 'gun moves', 'reaction', 'clamp stand', 'stop co', 'bunsen burner', 'simple activity', 'rocket moves', 'compressed gases', 'river bank', 'more examples', 'ar', 'action', 'direction', 'equal', 'force', 'water', 'small', 'third', 'test', 'gun', 'bullet', 'more', 'gases', 'rocket', 'bank', 'examples']"

Role of Atmosphere in Climate Control, look at the given image of solar system can you come to any ten al conclusions about the tempera ture of the different celestial bodies exactly we can say that the celestial bodies closer to the sun would be warmer than the bones away from it do you know why it is so well it is simply because the celesture bodies closer to the sun receive more heat and will be warmer and vice versa interestingly if we consider the temperature of the moon which is at the same distance from the sun like the earth there is ar contradiction to this pattern this is understand this in detail the aperattemperature on earth during the day is around forty degree celsis and at night it is around zero degree celsis on the other hand the aperattemperature on the moon during the day is around one hundred ten degree celss and at night is around mines one ninety degrees else can you guess the reason for this huge difference in temperature on the earth and the moon this happens as the earth is surrounded by ablanket of air called the atmosphere which is absent on the moon this clamped place or mature role in climate true on earth which enables the survival of organise on it but how does this happen the emerasphere is the bad conductor of heat during the day time the atmosphere around the earth does not allow all the heat from the sun to read earth surface therefore the temperature of earth during day time does not become very high moreover during the night the atmosphere around the earth does not allow all the heat to escape from the earth surface well the temperature does not drop to great extent this in night that the eras per close down the escape of heat from earth surface into outer space as it is at the aperattemperature of earth remains steady during day and night as we less throughout the year however due to the absence of an atmosphere on the moon the entire heat of the sun recres it surfaces so its temperature reaches up to one hundred ten degrees celsis during day time and at night the super of moon radiates the heat in to counter spheres and reaches up to in as one hundred ninety degrees celsius that is now perform an activity to understand the role of the atmosphere in climate control but there is required for this activity are to beakers about at thermometer water and soil or sand till one beaker with water and label it as be and second beakre with soil and laborit as be now take thermometer and place it in closed fate see keep the beakers and bottles in bright sunlight for three hours now measure and not the temperature of all the vessels simultaneously that the temperature reading of the air in the shade here we can observe that the temperature reading of beaker be is more than that of beaker ad do you know why this is because the soil teracomes hot and cold faster than water now best on this than you determine what would become hot faster the land or the sea we know that line discovered with soil so it will become hot faster than the see now compare the thermometer reading of the air in shape with that of the soil and water cap in bright sunlight are they the same know the readings will be different because of direct effect of the radiations in bright sunlight now canadeturem in the need of measuring the temperature in the shade the temperature sure be measured in the shape as it depicts the correct air temperature this is because the direct radiations from the sun influence the thermometer reading and make it non uniform now we call the temperature of the closed bottle that be kept in the sunlight till the temperature of air in the closed class vessel be the same as thratemperature measured in open air well we will observe that the temperature of air in the closed class vessel is more than the temperature measured in open air do you know why this happens due to thegreen house effect what is the greenhouse effect it is the phenomenon in which the solar radiation and re aclosed class vessel through the was and get trap as the real radiated race cannot escape into outer space this heats serve the air in the closed vessel do we ever come across this phenomenon of greenhouse effect in our daily life yes we come across this phenomenon when we park ar car in the sun due to the greenhouse effect the solar radiations get trapped in the car and it gets heated let sum rise the mean concepts,"['house effect', 'air temperature', 'solar radiations', 'direct effect', 'celestial bodies', 'closed fate', 'degrees celsis', 'degree celsis', 'thermometer water', 'thermometer reading', 'temperature reading', 'direct radiations', 'great extent', 'earth surface', 'day time', 'bad conductor', 'mature role', 'huge difference', 'other hand', 'same distance', 'tempera ture', 'al conclusions', 'air', 'solar', 'effect', 'climate', 'ar', 'heat', 'closed', 'bodies', 'degrees', 'degree', 'water', 'thermometer', 'temperature', 'radiations', 'same', 'role', 'day', 'earth', 'sun']"
Rutherford's Model, caram is an interesting game similar to billiards however instead of billiard cu stick we use or fingers and the striker in carom caram aims to flick the striker with the finger at the coins forcing them to fall into the corner pockets what happens if the striker flick by you misses the coin that you aimed at where would the striker go the striker in this case would goes stray without deflecting if in case the striker hits the coin in which direction would at go this time the striker either deflects by an angle alrebounds and comes back in reverse direction one can relate this exciting game of caram with the famous experiment conducted by the british physics or net rather fold known as rather forts alpha scattering experiment on test rather fold was born at spring grove on thirtiefogist eighteen hundred and seventy one he became famous for his work on radioactivity and the discovery of nucleus of an atom he was also known as the father of nuclear physics in nineteen hundred at he was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry rather forts alpha scattering experiment was carried out to understand the arrangement of the constituent particles in an atom in his experiment rather fordbombated the thin treat to gold foil with alpha particles emited by ar radioactive element like radium and polonium in an evacuated trimber he selected gold because it is a highly valuable metal that could be beaten into extremely thin sheets the alpha particles adubly charged to helium ions each having two units of positive charge and for in its of mass the fast moving alpha particles have considerable amount of energy they can penetrate through matter to some extent the alpha particles obtained from the radioactive element were enclosed in at block of let the lead block was placed behind elite screen that had the small hole in it so that an arrow beam of alpha particles could be produced this beam was directed towards the thin gold foil the thin gold foil was surrounded by ar movable floricent sinks of pits screen which produced sentelation and or visible flash of light when track then the fast moving alpha particles were allowed to strike the thin gold foil rather port found at most of the alpha particles emerged without much deviation some scattered through small angles while the other scattered through large angles ar few even scattered in the backward directions on the basis of these observations rather fold concluded from his scattering experiment that most of the space in side the atom is imply or hollow because most of the alpha particles passed through the gold foil without getting deflected some of the alpha particles were deflected from their path indicating the presence of positively charged for inside the atom known as nucleus ar very small faction off alpha particles completely bound bag indicating that the volume occupied by the nucleus is very small as compared to the total volume of an atom in nineteen hundred and eleven rtherford proposed his nuclear model of an atom on the basis of his alpha particles catering experiment the main points of this model art and atom consists of ar positively charged new least which is surrounded by the electrons moving around it in circular path known as orbit the electrostatic force of attraction between the positively charged to nucleus and the negatively charged electrons hold the atom together the new clears of an atom is tens and hard the size of the nucleus is very small as compared to the size of an atom almost the entire mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus atom as he whole is electrically neutral that is the number of protons inside the nucleus of an atm and the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus are equal though rather forts atomic model was the first successful model of an atom but yet it could not explain the stable ty of an atom this is because according to the rather forts model electrons move in afixed orbit with constant speed but according to the electromagnetic wave fury of max well whenever ar charged particle like an electron accelerated it loses its energy by emitting electromagnetic radiation and when an electron loses its energy it goes more close to the new clears and ultimately the electrons fall into the new clears in other words the atom should collapse however this does not actually happen and the atom is quite stable to overcome the draw back of rather forts model of an atom kneels bore proposed the new model of an atom to some arise at the end the important features and limitations of

The Movement of Air: Winds, have you ever vis tet as sea show if yes you might have felt the cool breeze on your fats these precise bring us al lot of relief in hot any weather similarly the win fall after hot weather brings us great relief now some questions might strike your mind such as what causes the movement of air of which factors de sight then the this movement of air will be in the form of at can to breeze as strong wind or tables to and what causes rain well interestingly these phenomenon take place due to changes in the surrounding atmosphere these changes are the result of the heating of the atmosphere and the formation of other beakers do you know how water waves or for yes you are right what or waves are formed by two major processes these are heating up of water bodies that results in the evaporation of water from the surface and activities from living organise let transpiration by plants and perspiration by animals do you know how the heating of the atmosphere aces that must are gets heated up by the solar radiations falling on the as it also gets heated from below by the radiations reflected from the earth and water bodies when the air near the surface of the earth gets heated it rises and creates al low pressure area it leads to the formation of convection currents in the air let us perform an activity understand the formation of convection currents in the air in detail for this the fire are beaker can de and insttake and are max take now take cent these set in are weaker and lighter latin incense take and bring it close to the at of mouth of the beta observe the direction in which the smoke flows well has the lighted instants take al little above the candle and now the direction of flow of smoke in the next tail late lighted incense take in other regions above the beak and observe the direction in which the smoke flows you will observe that the direction of the flow of smoke will be different in of the cases when the lighted incense take is placed at the edge of mouth of the beaker the smoke will flow into the beaker toward the candle and then above the beaker when the lighted incense take is placed alittle above the candle the smoke will move upwards lastly when the lighted incense take is take in other regions abof the beaker the smoke will flow towards the candle and then in the upward direction what can you can flow from the pan of flow of smoke well the patterns of the flow of smoke reveal the direction of movement of hot and cold air let us understand the in detail then the irabov the candle gets heated it rises and creates an low pressure area below it as it reside the irfrof the cold areas moves towards this low pressure area this pattern he flow of the incense tadmoke the peak the movement of air let us now relate this movement of the air to the precise during day tight the irover the land and water is heated by the solar radiations since we know that land gets heated faster than the water the irabove the land also gets heated faster as compared to the ir above the water bodies thus during day time in costal areas the ar above the land will get heated rapidly and will rise thus creating al low pressure area above the land as compared to the land the air above the sea will be relatively cooler as it reside the cool air over the high pressure area that is the sea will move towards will low pressure area that is land this movement of air from one region to another resolves in wins now can you determine the direction of went during the night exactly during night the air flows in the reverse direction why does it happen we know that land co sound faster than the water thus the air above the land cos down rapidly which results in the formation of a high pressure area over the land as compared to the sea hence the cold air over the land moves towards the sea here it can be stated that the movement of air in different directions is the result of the uneven heating of the atmosphere over different regions of the earth moreover the divers types of atmospheric phenomenon like breezes thunderstorm sight clones mons on rains and wind stones depend on the difference in air pressure between different regions do you know that some other factors also influence the movement of air these are uneven heating of atmosphere at different regions of the earth rotation of earth difference in topography over which the win passes and presence of mountain ranges in the path of winds here arises an interesting question how does the presence of the hemalias changes the direction of vents glowing from allahabad to the northern regions well during the hot summers the regions of the north ingen subcontinent heat up simultaneously the air above these regions also heats up and rises thereby leaving behind a low pressure area to fill the void the moisture laden vents from allahabad that is the high pressure area moves into the subcontinent when these vents move upwards the hemalias act as a high wall and block their movement into the central asia and foresthem to rise as the moisture laden vent rises that temperature drops which leads to the formation of clouds and ultimately this leads to precipitation now let recapitulate the main concepts,"['latin incense take', 'other regions', 'air pressure', 'incense take', 'different regions', 'high pressure', 'areas

Uniform and Non-uniform Motion, you may have heard the famous story about the trees between a rabbit and atortes yes the same one in which rabbit being faster than taut is lost the rays they were required to start from the same point simultaneous late and reach to the same finishing line to in the rays but rabbit was over confident over his speed so he decided to rest many times during the rays whereas the taut is gave his contineous effort without resting in between and von the rays to re verify this historic rays to school students conducted the same race between a rabbit and taut to the are surprise this time also the taut is one both tons were curious that without is is winning although its lower than the rabbit to find the answer to this the decided to an destined the nature of the motion for this they again made the taut is an rabbit to rays and collected the data for distance covered and find taken between them as shown here when the studied the data regarding the motion of the torters they observed that the of is covers three meters in the first two minutes another three meters in the next two minutes and continues to travel covering three meters every two minutes based on the data they concluded that cart is is moving at uniform rate all is in uniform motion they also decided distudy the motion of totisgofically and found that the distance time graph comes out to be as straight lime next the studied the motion of the rabbit after in showing that the rabbit also reaches the finish lime they observed that rabbit cover three meters in the first two minutes and find meters in the next two minutes then he stops to take an nap for four minutes and awacance to finish the last four meters in two minutes but when he reaches the finished line he finds that the taut is has already von the rays these on the data they observed that the motion of the rabbit is non uniform next the plotted the distance time graph for the rabbits journey and observed it to be ar curve as shown here both the students were quite excited about the finding recording the types of motion observed in the case of rabbit and tartes they discuss this in the class with their teacher teacher appreciated their inquisitiveness and said that more examples of these types of motion can be observed in our daily lice he for the added that one of the examples is the motion of cars on the road when the car is moving on as we road with no disturbance due to traffic in such a case if it covers equal distances in equal intervals of time it is in uniform motion however if the car enters at rabbit street then it does not cover equal distances in equal intervals of time due to the traffic it covers unequal distances in equal intervals of time all it can be said that it is travelling at an non uniform speed let us look at some more examples of uniform and non uniform motion the hands of ac clock are in the state of uniform motion since they cover equal distances in equal intervals of time ar ball rolling on as moth plane with constant speed is set to be in ar uniform motion whereas when the plane is bumpy are inclined the ball executes non uniform motion hope now you can find some more examples test on the same concept can you let us now recapitulate the concept studied,"['ar uniform motion', 'same finishing line', 'same point simultaneous', 'time ar', 'uniform speed', 'uniform motion', 'equal distances', 'uniform', 'same', 'rabbit street', 'daily lice', 'rabbits journey', 'school students', 'historic rays', 'contineous effort', 'many times', 'famous story', 'ar', 'time', 'examples', 'lime', 'distances', 'equal', 'line', 'motion', 'speed', 'students', 'rays', 'rabbit']"

Conservation of momentum, you must have observed that when the speeding truck strikes stationary car the car starts moving in the direction of for supplied by the track in this case the velocity of the track decreases and the velocity of the car increases as we know that momentum the band upon the velocity of the given object thus change in velocity will bring in the change in momentum as the result momentum of the track decreases and the momentum of the car increases it is observed that the amount of decrease in the momentum of the track is equal to the amount of increase in the momentum of the car so there is no loss of momentum in the collision this demonstrate the law of conservation of momentum according to the law of conservation of momentum when two or more bodies interact with one another the total momentum of the system remains constant provided no external forces are acting suppose that track and the car is moving in the same direction with different velocities let the mass of the track be am one and its velocity be one so its initial momentum is am one one let the mass and velocity of the car by am to and two respectively so the initial momentum of the car is an to two thus the total momentum of the track and the car before collision is am one won plus and two to suppose the truck and the car co lie for a short period of time de after the collision the velocity of the car and the track will change let the velocity of the track and the car after the collision be we one and we to respectively after the collision the momentum of the track changes to am one we one and momentum of the car changes to nm to we to suppose during the collision the force applied by the track of the car is ef one and in turn the car exerts of force ef to on the track from the newton second law of motion the force exerted by the track on the car is given by force ef one equals to mass of the car am to interchange in velocity of the car that is we to minus two divided by time t now the force exerted by the car on the traces denote car ef two force ef to is equal to mass am one into change in the velocity of the track that is we one minus one divided by time de the force exerted by the track on the car is the action and the force exerted bar the car on the track is the force of reaction according to there law of motion force of action and reaction are equal and opposite now putting the values of for one and if two and rearranging the terms we get the required equation of law of conservation of momentum equation on left hand side represents the total momentum of the track and the car before collision equation on it and sad represents the total momentum of the track and the car of the collision this shows that the total momentum of the system of two bodies before and after the collision remains constant and conserved,"['denote car', 'car changes', 'car am', 'momentum equation', 'car', 'track changes', 'momentum', 'mass am', 'different velocities', 'same direction', 'external forces', 'more bodies', 'equation', 'hand', 'second', 'force', 'track', 'bodies', 'short', 'am', 'mass', 'direction']"
Contact and Non+AC0-contact Forces, when you push or box with your hands you apply force on the box in this case hands are in contact with the box but what in agays of leaves falling from ar tree is there any forcexess yes the earth exerts force on the lies to the leaf is not in contact with the earth in general forces divided into two major tacts contact forces and non contact forces let us study about contact forces forces that two bodies in contact apply on each other are known as contact forces to pussh pull or left things arountas we apply contact forces because our hands or feet are in contact with the upset sometimes there are situations when we apply ar contact force on something without tactually touching them as you can see that are person applies to force on the rope and rope applies to force on the bucket this type of contact force applied by ar rope or ar wire is known as tension tension acts along the rope from which are bucket hands in awell or the vi or from which al lamp hands let us now discuss about the non contact forces forces that act between two bodies even when they are not in contact with each other are known as non contact forces the force of gravity can act on our body even when it is not in contact with the earth magnetic force and electro stactict force are common examples of non contact forces,"['ar contact force', 'contact forces forces', 'tacts contact forces', 'earth magnetic force', 'contact force', 'contact forces', 'lamp hands', 'stactict force', 'common examples', 'things arountas', 'contact', 'ar', 'hands', 'force', 'earth', 'forces']"

Equations of Motion, suppose that you and your friend are plain catch at the top of ar building that is twenty meters high your friend then accident liter of the ball can you tell when and with what speed the ball will hit the ground at the same time are boys standing on the ground notice is this and on stu give the boys the ball back what is the minimum speed with which he must throw the ball so that it reaches the answers to these questions can be found by applying the equations of motion do you know what the equations of motion are yes you are right the motion of objects moving with the constant acceleration is the von by the equation these equations are called the equations of motion let us discuss these equations one by one do you know what the first equation of motion tells us yes you are absolutely right the first equation of motion gives the final velocity of an object at any time if its initial velocity and its acceleration are known let us derive this equation from the velocity time graph of ar body moving with constant acceleration suppose the acceleration of an object moving with an initial velocity is its velocity at any instant of time can be given by the velocity time graph shown let its final velocity at at time de we as indicated here in the graph the initial state and the final state of the object are represented in the graph by points and we respective ar perpendicular line be is drawn from point be on the time axis in us similar manner another perpendicular be is drawn from point on the velocity axes so we initial velocity is represented by the final velocity is represented by bc and oste represents the time duration ti in which the velocity changes from you to let us now draw another perpendicular ad from point on bc thus we do represents the change in velocity and is equal to vi min as on applied the the nation of acceleration to this velocity time graft we cans that we excellration is the ratio of the lend of be to the length of oc on substituting the values of bed and oc we get the first equation of motion which is we equal to plus at having derived the first equation of motion let us move on to the second equation of motion do you know what the second equation of motion tells us you are right the second equation of motion gives the displacement of al object at any time if its initial velocity and its excelaration are known again using the velocity time graph of ar body moving with initial velocity and ar constant acceleration we will derive this equation we know that the displacement of the body is equal to the area under its velocity time graph suppose the initial state of the body is represented by point and the final state by point be tet is placement of the body is then given by the area oabc and the graph ab this area can be calculated as shown substituting the value of oa as oc as ti ad as ti and be as at from the first equation of motion we get the second equation of motion as is equal to out less half at square having derived the first and the second equation of motion all that is left for octodo is to derive the third equation of motion do you know what the third equation of motion tells us yes you are right the third equation of motion gives the relation between the initial velocity the final velocity the acceleration and the displacement as de area under the graph ab represents the displacement of the body this area is the area of porvelatral oabc which is at rope can do you know what the expression for are of at trapezium is yes you are right it is the product of the sum of the lengths of the pale sides and the perpendicular distance between the two pale sides divided by to thus the area of the trapezium oabc is are shown substituting oat bc with we and oswit we get the displacement are shown from the first equation of motion we get the valley of th as we mines divided by substituting this value of ti into the expression for displacemen and simplyfing the expression we get the third equation of motion which is we square fine square equals to twice as now that we have derive the equations of motion let us apply them for finding answers to the questions that we asked in the beginning it is know that under the influence of only eats gravity all objects move with the same constant acceleration ga therefore the ball in the situation presented above moves with ar constant acceleration the time taken by the ball to he the ground can be cal culated by applying the second equation of motion as shown here now that we have calculated the time we can determine the final speed of the ball using the first equation of motion the boy is returning the ball must throw it vertically upward so that the speed of throw is minimum at maximum height this minimum speed can be calculated by applying the third equation of motion let us now summarise the concept learn,"['velocity time graph', 'velocity time', 'ar constant acceleration', 'same time', 'same

Force and its Effects, you might have seen in agame of note that the cue ball remains at rest until it is head by the cutin once in motion the cue ball moves on to strike another stationary ball thereby starting its motion in this game the cues stick applies the force on the cue ball by hitting it in a similar manner the cue ball applies the force on the ball that it has and sets it in motion but do you know water forces force is an external effort over an object that sets it in motion al brings ar moving object to rest apart from this the force can increase or decrease the speed of ar moving object all can change its shape size or both to have more clarity about the force and its effects let us at that as string to of wooden block placed on at table when the spring is pull the block begins to mol this is because when the force is applied on the string to pulled then the string simultaneously applies afors on the blow this can be verified by observing that the string is stout when the block begins motion thus afoceis required to set as stationary object in motion you might have also observe the same while playing football it is not possible for afootball to move on its own until an unless you kicked this speed of or moving ball cannot increase on its own afoceis required but is it possible for apart to stop ar moving object yes it is possible to verify this due can to seed with the previous demonstration using ab block and string this time let us attach the other end of the block to aball by ar string not set the blocking motion by pulling the string attached to another red we can see that the block comes to rest after moving on this tens do you know why it happen this is because the ball applied the force on the block against its direction of motion which is clearly visible by the out string thus aforce is also required to bring ar moving object to rest but does an object stops suddenly when force is applied to stop it no when afre acts on the object against its direction of motion it gradually starts flowing down and after some time it comes to rest so aforscan set an object in motion or stop it from moving also it can increase or decrease the speed of the object but is aforserequired to keep an object in continuous motion no in apractical word ar moving object is always in comb tet by the force of friction due to the runessof the surface over which it is moving the force of friction always slows down ar moving object however in an imaginary world with outbfriction once an object will be set in to motion by applying force it will remain in motion tilturnitad in tristingly in such aborl no force will be required to maintain the motion of the object let us see if ar force can change the direction of motion of an object or not you might have observed an outlet participating in a hammer through competition the hammer is the heavy metal ball attached by asteel wire to agreed the atly holding the grip walls the metal ball round and round and finally release is at the for the grit is released the metal ball on the goes as circular motion thereby continuously changing its direction of motion this is because the out metal wire applies he force on the metal ball towards the centre of the circuiol this can be verified by observing that once the at let releases the grip the metal while becomes slack the inward force disappears and the metal ball this continues its circular motion thus another effect of force is that it can change the direction of motion apart from this aforse can also change the shape of the object over which it acts to verify this and of voter balloon at it capping born ball and hit the water balloon with it you will be able to see the change in the shape of the balloon clearly due to the fore applied by the pin bang ball over rd you can also observe the change in shape of two solid objects upon the pollution but it is less prominent as compared to the water filled balloon thus all these examples clearly ages that ar force can change the shape of the object but can ar force change the size of the object yes it can for example when as spring attached to the ball is struck by an metal ball it gets compressed and its size decreases as soon as the springs restoring force comes into action the ball gets push the way and the spring gets ilongated and size of the spring is observed to be greater than its normal condition thus its lear that force can change the size of the object over which it acts now lets re capture at what we have learn ,"['metal ball', 'can ar

Inertia, an object rolling on the floor comes to rest after covering some distance do you know why yes it is due to the external force called friction which produces at change in the state of motion again acup of tea kept on the table unless it is disturbed by sample by the application of ar force have you ever thought that why in motiect without the help of an external force cannot change its state of rest or of uniform motion along astraight line the once is very simple that it is the property of the body this property is assigned the name inertia let us understand by taking examples from daily life here we can see the football is in the state of rest it comes into motion when non zero external force is applied on it again we can see that football in uniform motion comes to rest when non zero external force is applied on it hence it is due to inertia by what to of which objects are unable to change their state of rest or of uniform motion in he straight line without the help of an external force do you know that the inertia of body is measured by the mass of the body let us see how here we can see that car and cycula moving with the same speed or big force is required to stop the car than that to stop ar cycle hence mass of body is ameasure of inertia inertia can be classified into three categories inertia of rest inertia of motion inertia of direction let us understand each one of them with an example inertia of rest is the inability of the body to change by itself its state of rest let see how here we can see that an egg is placed on aplate covering the glass now what do you think where the egg will go when apple is strike by the person with the force the plate slips away and eg falls into the glass this is due to inrtia of rest that eg women in its position and hence tell into the glass let us now take an example of inertia of motion inertia of motion is the inability of the body to change by itself its state of uniform motion have you ever noticed that an at least one ascertain distance before taking along jump this is due to inertia of motion because velocity acquired by running is added to the velocity of the at lead at the time of jump hence he is able to jumped over along the tance let us now distance inertia of direction with an example inertia of direction is the inability of the body to change by itself its direction of motion have you ever noticed that rotating wheels of any weekers throw out mud tangentially this is due to directional inertia the mud guards over the wheels stop allowing the mud to fall on the riders clothes,"['inertia inertia', 'motion inertia', 'distance inertia', 'inertia', 'ar force', 'at lead at', 'external force', 'straight line', 'astraight line', 'riders clothes', 'mud guards', 'ascertain distance', 'eg women', 'same speed', 'daily life', 'ar cycle', 'force', 'motion', 'mud', 'eg', 'at', 'distance']"
Introduction to Force, the actions like hitting hitting lifting pushing pulling are often used to elaborate certain tasks each of these terms can be replaced with the dome force when you push a heavy load or adoor you exert a force on them similarly when you pull a rope you exert a force on it the bigger the force the more movement it can produce from all the examples discussed we can infer that at least two objects must interact for are force to come into play,"['dome force', 'certain tasks', 'force', 'heavy']"
Introduction to Newton's Laws of Motion, newtons laws of motion a ball kept on the field does not change its position by itself a player comes and gates the ball the ball changes its state of rest to motion is an external force needed to change the state of rest of the ball two piles of tiles are placed in the field atrained karate player and an untrained boy both tried to break the pile of tiles it gets broken in the case of the trained karate player as is action is very quick does the amount of force exerted depend on the time interval in which it is applied here we see aspring balance attached to a wall another spring balance is attached to the first one now force is applied to pull the second spring balance we observe that the reading in both the spring balances is same when force is applied by one body over the other while the second body also exert of force on the first one to answer these questions we need to study the three laws of motion formulated by sirisic newton famous physicist mathematician astronomer natural philosopher and atheologic,"['newton famous physicist mathematician astronomer natural', 'second spring', 'karate player', 'external force', 'newtons laws', 'spring', 'second', 'laws', 'force', 'player']"

Number of Tangents From a Point on a Circle, we know that the tangent to a circle is the quit line that touches the circle at one point only now aquestion ariseles how many tangents can be drawn from a point to a circle let us explore it the point can be inside the circle on the circle or outside the circle let us try to draw tangents to the circle from the point py that lies inside the circle we find that all the lines through the point in the sec the circle in two points so it is not possible to draw any tangent to a circle through ar point inside now consider the point py on the circle and draw tangents through this point we observe that there is only one tangent to the circle at such a point now we take the point py outside the circle and try to draw tangents to the circle from this point we observe that we can draw exactly two tangents to the circle through this point observe that py one and pito are the points of contact of the tangents pit one and pit to the spectivel drawn from apoint outside the circle the length of the segment of the tangent from the external point be to the point of contact with the circle is called the length of the tangent from the point py to the circle so pit one and pit to are the length of the tangents from pto the circle measure pit one and pit to are these equal yes lengths of pit one and pit to are equal in fact lengths of tangents on a circle from an external point are always equal let us prove this fact the just obtain ofbservation is actually as statement of atherum which states that the length of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal here is he circle with centre oapointp line outside the circle and two tangents pit par on the circle from external point we have to prove that pit is equal to par join opi oc and or angles okup and or py are right angles because radius is always perpendicular to tangent at point of contact now in right trangles occupy and or py oku is equal to or as they are radii of the same circle op is common to both triangles therefore triangle okup is congruent to trangle oarp so pitu is equal to per as they are congruent parts of congruent triangles also angle opto is equal to angle opar therefore opiis the angle bisector of angle cup ar that is the centered lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents let us work out an example was on the length of tangents to a circle drawn from a point outside the circle find the length of the tangent to a circle of radius six anti meters drawn from a point which is at distance of ten centimetres from the centre of the circle let there be acircle with centre oandwitia six centimetres let petione and petitu we two tangents from apointp which is at a distance of tens anti meters from the centre of the circle draw line segments out one and out to radio ti one and otitu are perpendicular to the tangents pit one and pit to respectively therefore triangle spite one oandpitito o are right angled triangles in right angled trangle pit one ootione is six anti meters as it is the radius of the circle it is given that op is tensentimetrs by using patageras term opisquared is equal to pit one squared less otionesquar on substituting the values of opi and option we get one hundred is equal to petione squared plasthirty as on further simplification we get pit one as eight centimetres hence the length of the tangents is eight centimetres its time to have ape re cap of what we have learnt so far exactly to tangents can be drawn on a circle from apoint outside the circle the lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal,"['circle measure pit', 'centre oapointp line', 'angle cup ar', 'tangents pit', 'point py', 'ar point', 'congruent triangles', 'congruent parts', 'right trangles', 'right angles', 'further simplification', 'patageras term', 'triangle okup', 'fact lengths', 'angles okup', 'line', 'circle', 'angle', 'pit', 'point', 're', 'right', 'anti', 'congruent', 'centre', 'tangents', 'py', 'triangle', 'fact', 'lengths', 'triangles']"

Problems Based on Heights and Distances, tri no metre hits to mica angle sand distances without having to calculate them physically measuring an angle on or big bees of land or the height of or building can be device we can find dstamentions indirectly using trignometry and the available measurements word problems in trignometry or base on realisinarios and cangwesolved vitrignometric ratios and identities mostly trignometric problems involved determination of his distances or angles of be devation or depression for can veins trignometric word problems can be divided into shirtain cat degrees la determining the height of or building pave pole or light houses which are at as certain distance from ships determining the vi of rivers or roads and so on let solve of word problem of trignometree the angles of depression of the top and bottom of of fourteen meter to building from the top of another building are thirty degrees and sixty degrees respectively find the height of the second building to solve any word problem the first step is to identify the in formation which is given and what is required for finding the solution in the given problem it is given that there are two buildings height of one building is fourteen meters the angles of depression of the top and bottom of of fourteen meter tall building from the top of another building or thirty degrees and sixty degrees respectively and we to find the height of the second building after identification we draw adigram for the given en formation to provide visual reference and lag the given values of the angles and sides and ma the values which need to be determin let be be the building whose height is given as fourteen meter let ac bb other building whose height is say why meters let ex by the distance dc between both the buildings we can construct or right angle triangle ab were ab equals dc equals ex meters so bc bb equal to fourteen meters and ab equals way minus fourteen meters we are given that the angles of the pression of the top and bottom of the building de from the top of the other building ac are thirty degrees and sixty degrees respectively since the angle of depression to the top of the building is thirty degrees angle b is also thirty degrees as the angle of depression and angle are the alternate in dry angles between the tale lines am and angle of depression to the btom of the building de is sixty degrees so the angle dc is also sixty degrees the finglestep in volts of land fricnometric concepts to determine the requisite valleys in the right angled triangle be tan of thirt degrees equals by upon be we can substitute tan of third as one upon square root of three ab as vi minus fourteen and b as ext in de equation on simplifying it we get ex equals square root of three things whole of vi minus forty take this as equation one in the right angle triangle cd tan of sixty degrees equals upon dc we can substitute tan of sixty as square root of three ac as vi and dc as extend equation on simplifying it we get the square root of three tanks exequalswy we substitute the value of is from equation one and simplify to get why equal to twenty one so the height of the second building is twenty one meters here is another problem two ships are in dic such that they are on either side of or light house in as tray line the angles of depression of the two ships from the top of the light house are sixty degrees and forty five degrees the height of the light house is two hundred meters what is the distance between the ships by using the given information we draw atigram for visual referens let ab be the light house with height two hundred meters lets and bb two ships on either side of the light houses the angle of depression from point to c is forty five degrees and from dub is sixty degrees by alternate angle property for pale lines angle cd is equal to forty five degrees and angle dc is equal to sixty degrees in the right angled triangle bc tan forty five degrees equals by upon bc this implies that one equals two hundred upon bc as tan of forty five degrees equals one therefore bc equals two hundred meters consider this as the quaion one in the right angled triangle bb tan sixty degrees equals by upon by day so squarut of three equals two hundred upon bb as stand sixty degrees equals square root three therefore bb equals two hundred times square root of three upon three meters consider this as the quasion to the distance between the ships is seed but cd equals bc plus bb substituting the values of dc and bb from equations one and two respectively we get cd equals three hundred fifteen point three meters thus the distance between the two ships is three hundred fifteen point three meters here is the problem in which the tree of and aeroplane is to be found out the angle of elevation of and aeroplane from up point on the ground is sixty degrees after or flight of threentysecons we elevation changes to thirty degrees the aeroplane is flying at aponstan time of three thousand times square root of three meters find the bed of beropla the estate the point owe as the point of savetion and as the first position of aeroplane and as the second position in the sky the position of the aeroplane hundred ground corresponding to the positions tea and or and em respectively angle bom equals thirty degrees an angle om equals sixty degrees join to and betom by dotted lines in the diagram equals pm equals three thousand times square root of three meters join the points top with ar dotted line distance ab is covered in twenty secrs when the aeroplane is at equals three thousand times square root of three meters an angle om equals sixty degrees in the right angled triangle ol ol upon ml equals cotangent of sixty degrees this implies om equals three thousand times square root of three holtimes one upon square root of three so om equals three thousand meters consider this as the quasiond one when the aeroplane is at b be m equals three thousand times square root of three meters an angle bom equals thirty degrees in the right angle triangle om b om upon b m equals epotungen of thirty degrees so om equals three thousand times square root of three hole times square root of three so om equals nine thousand meters consider this as the equation to from equations one and two ab equals lm equals om minus om which is equal to nine thousand minus three thousand equals six thousand meters now the distance covered in twenty secins equals six thousand meters therefore the distance covered in an have are thirty six hundred seconds equals one thousand and it kilometres therefore the be of the aeroplane is one thousand and de kilometres baraver here is aproblem in which unto find the red of ar river an man from or hotter balloon at an altitude of two hundred and fifty metre observes the angle of depressions of two bats on opposite sits of or river to be forty five and sixty degrees respectively find the width of the river let be the position of the of abaloon and bc be the river let bb the point in bc just three low the balloon let b dc by the two bolts on opposed times of the river with angls of depressions sixty degrees and forty five degrees we text from suppose bb is ex and dc is why in the right angled triangle dc tan forty five degre equals upon bc on substituting the values ad and bc we get one equals two hundred fifty upon vi or why which is the measurement of bc is equal to two hundred and fifty meters in the right angle triangle bb tan sixty degres equals ad upon bb this implies the square root of three equals two hundred fifty upon is on solving it further we get ex uichis the measurement of bb is equal to one hundred forty foot point three meters so the total bit of the river is bb quasbc which equals thre hundred ninety four point three meters so these were some examples of application of trignometory in real life apart from finding the heights distances and bits of

Tangent to a circle, you might have seen cause cycles and other vehicles travelling on ar road have we ever observed the path traced by the feel of ar running car on the road let us observe it we observe that the path is the straight loint do you know what name of the line is if we consider this we as the circle then this line is non at the tangent to the circle we can observe tangents in various realise situations such as or pully fitted over awele abicicle moving on ar road and sparks produced during the shaping of an knife against are grinding be the word tangent comes from the latin word tangere which means to touch it was introduced by the tanish mathematician to us fin ac in fifteen at thr we just observe the position of ar line with respect to the circle let us now examine the defensituationts that can arise when he circle and are line are given in ar plain consider as circle and alineku there can be three possibility here we see that line and circle are nithe touching nor in the citing so line be cu is non intersecting line with respect to the circle now the line intersects the circle at two points and b it means line and the circle have two common points therefore we cu is as secant of the circle in third case the line be cu and the circle have one common point that is it means the line pecuirtucting the circle at one point and so it is called atangent to the circle therefore we can say that atngent to a circle is ar line that intersects the circle at only one point this point is called point of cone that can you just tell how many tangents can be drawn at the point on ar given circle think about at lets observe an activity to answer the question draw circle on atom or cause with the help of abangle now take a straw and label its ends as b we this tw by by pen at ar point p on the circle in circle we that straw can rotate about the point be when we rotates straw ab about the point bp we can different positions of the straw when it rotates on the circle it intersects the circle at the point be and also at other points like c b and and so on in one situation westhat straw ab intersects the circle at only one point p at that time the straw be becomes at tangent to the circle this shows that the tangent exists at the point on the circle similarly when we rotate the straw ab further it intersects the circle at points g and so on thus we can can clue that only one tangent exists at the point be on the circle did you observe anything elsenthis activity observe that while rotating the straw ab its intersection point with the circle say comes closer to the point be and ultimate we coin sides with it so we can say that atngent to a circle is the special case of the secant when the two end points of its corresponding cot coincide we note that the secant is the line which intersects he circle at two points and are cord of ar circle is the line segment joining any two points on the circle let us discuss one more property of tangents with the help of another activit draw circle with the suitable radius and draw ar secant ab this secant by intersects the circle at bp and now draw another secant pale to ab on either side circle observe that the length orcthecort decreases as we move away from the secant ab on ithe side and at last the length of the part becomes zero on eithe cite of the secant ab the secant become the tangents to the circle so lines and fg are the tangents to the circle which are pale to secant ab therefore we can conclude that there cannot be more than to tangents pale to ar given secant here an earlier result on tangents can also be seen if both the end points of or cart point side then the corresponding secant becomes tangent to the circle,"['draw ar secant ab', 'ar point', 'point side', 'ar circle', 'ar plain', 'ar line', 'point', 'other points', 'secant ab', 'secant pale', 'draw circle', 'side circle', 'realise situations', 'ar', 'tangents pale', 'points', 'elsenthis activity', 'c b', 'different positions', 'nithe touching', 'fin ac', 'tanish mathematician', 'awele abicicle', 'straight loint', 'word', 'secant', 'draw', 'case', 'side', 'circle', 'tangents', 'other', 'ab', 'pale', 'line', 'activity', 'b']"
Trigonometric Identities, in geometry many times we need to sol triangles quadrilaterals at seta to solve tin all or quotelatral means that if some of their measurements are given then we have to find the remaining ones for example is in aritangl triangle the lengths of its two sines are given we can find the length of its or side by using patigerous term but how will you find the other sides and angles if only one side and one of the acutangles of this triangle are given in such case by tigers term wooden self the corpus and finding them by measure men is tin consuming and not always convenient in such cases trinometr especially the trignometric ratios we very important role the word tricnometr self set that it is the state of triangles if you recall we had learnt the values of tricnometricquatioes of some specific angles like zero degree third degrees fortified degrees sixty degrees and ninety degrees we use them frequently in trignometry consider an equation sin theta

Laws of Reflection, laws of reflection the reflection of light takes place according to two definite laws let us study these laws one by one the angle of incidents eye is always equal to angle of reflection are in short angle lie is equal to angle are another law of reflection is the incident ray normal to the point of incidents and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane your own reflection that you see every day in ar looking glass is he common example of reflection of light the movies running on the screen of re projector is another example of reflection of light we can see the image of various objects around the water body in word edence hi did this is again due to the reflection of light,"['own reflection', 'same plane', 'incidents eye', 'definite laws', 'ray', 'angle', 'common', 'incidents', 'reflection', 'laws']"
Life cycle of Butterfly, depending upon the tie the life span of butterfly and moth may vary from amonth to ayear both butterfly and moth show complete metamorpices and undergo four main stages in the life cycle egg caterpillar cup and adult all butterflies and moths are oviparas and can lay of few hundred to thousand eggs in their entire life span female butterflies lay eggs on leaves during late spring season eggs are small round or oval shape eggs are laid on those leaves that can become food for the caterpillar in future eggs are filled with nutritios fluid that is used by developing caterpillars but their growth inside the egg in one to three leaves caterpillars hatch from the eggs the caterpillar or lava is the long worm like stage of the life cycle of both butterfly and moth it often has an interesting pattern of patches and it may also have spine like hair it is the feeding and growing stage caterpillar needs to eat constantly so that these can grow quickly initially caterpillar is extremely small but when it starts eating it rapidly grows and increases in size during their grow caterpillars shed their skin fall to fightizes the pupa also called criciles is the transformation stage with in which the caterpillar tissues are broken down and the adult insect structures the wings eyes proposes ton and antenna are formed cricilly stage of most of the species is brown or green in taller and blends into the background many species remain in this stage throughout winters it protects the developing pupi from its predators a cocoon is the silk and wrapping that protects many moth pupil on completion of metamorpices of caterpillar atle develops the pupil skin gets digested the emergence of the butterfly is called it closure its wings are softer than silk at this moment and very small and size the circulatory fluid is then pumped into very thin veins in the wings the wings are still very soft and lead two to three hours to get hardened the atle or immago is the reproductive stage of the species these ate undergo meeting and egg lane when afemale lays its eggs life cycle starts all over again,"['stage caterpillar', 'egg caterpillar', 'spring season eggs', 'many moth pupil', 'eggs life', 'shape eggs', 'caterpillar', 'pupil skin', 'wings eyes', 'grow caterpillars', 'interesting pattern', 'long worm', 'small round', 'female butterflies', 'main stages', 'complete metamorpices', 'eggs', 'life', 'many', 'stage', 'egg', 'insect', 'fluid', 'skin', 'moth', 'thin', 'wings', 'metamorpices', 'small', 'grow', 'caterpillars', 'butterflies']"
Light Enables us to See, without light we cannot see anything light is the form of energy which stimulates the sensation of vision we cannot see light but everything that is visible to us is due to light only when the light is emitted from an object or reflected from it can our eyes detect the object the objects that emit light onb their own are called luminous objects and the objects that have no light of their own are called non luminous objects non luminous objects can be seen only in the presence of luminous objects but how do our eyes enable us to see both these types of objects when light coming from ar luminous object strikes and gets reflected from an non luminous object it enters our eyes these rays of light fall on the retina at the back of our eye from where they reach the brain through object nerves the brain interprets the image formed on the retina enabling us to see the object we see luminous objects from the light it emits and non luminous object from the light it reflects hence it can be concluded that there are three conditions necessary for us to be able to see an object one there must be a source of light to the light must strike the object three the light must be reflected from the object to the eyes,"['non luminous objects non luminous objects', 'non luminous object', 'luminous object', 'luminous objects', 'light fall', 'light onb', 'object', 'conditions necessary', 'light', 'objects']"

Metamorphosis, we observe a lot of changes in our body as we grows there are animals that made these types of changes as apart of an extremely important life process non as metamorphosis metamorphosis refers to striking change in the form or structure of an individual after hatching or birds what do you think we the human beings undergo metamorphosis no it is because in human beings body parts similar to those present in the adults are present from the time of birth you may have seen the young ones of different animals either born or hatched from the eggs have you ever notice that in some animals the young ones resemble their parents while in others the young ones who look very different from the adults let us take as simple example of silk worm as silk worm undergoes for distinct stages of development which are egg caterpillars fupa and adults the silk wrm is owiparis the female silk moth lays about three hundred to four hundred eggs in clusters upon mulbury leaves at at time the larva hatches from the eggs within tend to twelve days the larva called caterpillar goes to munching on the malbury leaves as soon as it leaves the egg it eats day and night and increases enormously inside after twenty five to thirty days the caterpillars stops eating and enters the next stage of its slide side at this stage the caterpillars spins itself in a silk cocoon to hold itself and then it swings his head from side to side here it is called apupa further development of the moth continues inside the cocoon within the cocoon the worm changes into ar moth and emoges as an adult within one to two weeks to extend our perception let us take one more example that as frog as you know there are three distinct stages in the life cycle of ar frog which are egg larva and aduls a female frog can lay up to both housed eggs in water which are glued together by ajelly like substance which protect the eggs from drying out and time the meal deposits sperms over them and thus for tilization takes place a few days later the embryo inside the eggs starts developing into ar tadpole this tadpole emerges out of the egg at at pole has at tail and gills like fish for swimming and breathing in water it looks different from an adult frog in easily that old page on the remaining youth after seven to eight days it starts swimming feeling in water and feeds on alga and water plants as it matures it grows small date loses its gills and develops lungs after a few weeks the hind limbs develop and they are followed by the for lens the head becomes more distant and the body long gates the deal keeps reducing the young frog now comes outside the water its lungs are fully developed to greed on land as it grows on sides it steel completely disappears the frog is now are fully grown adults what did you observe in body examples in both the exampals we observe that the features which are present in the adult are not found in the young ones these young ones are adapted to environments and modes of life that our different from those of the adult forms do you know what can be disignificance of these differences the dees significance of these differences is to as sore that larva and aderts of the same species do not en gate in direct competition for food or pays,"['beings body parts', 'silk moth', 'ar frog', 'life process', 'young frog', 'adult frog', 'silk', 'ar moth', 'direct competition', 'same species', 'dees significance', 'hind limbs', 'small date', 'water plants', 'old page', 'egg larva', 'slide side', 'next stage', 'distinct stages', 'different animals', 'frog', 'life', 'body', 'few', 'further', 'example', 'ar', 'beings', 'adult', 'young', 'water', 'side', 'stage', 'larva', 'egg', 'different', 'animals', 'moth']"

National Park, this shear during the summer holidays rohu went to reset the south fur or national par with his family he asked his father why national parks are created his father told him that national parks are large and divers areas that are created to protect whole sets of ecosystems but the question is how are they heldful to the invarments well they help in the preservation of flora one landscape and is toric objects of an area you will be amazed to know that the south pure national part is the first preserve forest of finia do you know what the specialities forest is well the finest indiente his found in this pores rohu asked his father are there more national parks and idea his father told him that there are more than one hundred national parks in in dia you will be surprised to know that apart from the vi life the south boron national part has also preserve the heritete of the prehistoric period do you know what the evidence of the prehistoric period years rock shelters present an side the south boron national part are evidence of prehistoric human life in these forests this evidence provides as where the glims of the life of primitive people about fifty five rock shelter have been identified in patch many bias per reserve in these shelters you can observe racpaintings made vi primitive people who do these paintings depict figures of animals and men fighting hunting dancing and playing musical instruments are the pectate in these paintings you will be surprised to now that veristrivals still in habit this area while moving ahead rohans suddenly saw abound which suburatiger reserve was written he asked his father about it his father told him about project age which was launched by the indian government to protect the tigers rohu asked what the objective of this project is his father explained that the objective of this project was to in sure the survival and preservation of the tiger population in in dia you must have seen reports of the declining population of various species of animals unfortunately the tiger is one such species but the supra tiger reserves unique do you know why is considered to be unique saturatiger reserve is unique as as significant increase and that agopopulation has been observed hear rohu asked his father what the other animals are also found her his father told him that previously animals like lions elephant while buffaloes and boratingr were also found in the supuraur national park however the number of some animals as declining to ar level that they might become extinct is there any specific term for the category of animals these animals known as endangered animals can you name any animal which became extinct along time ago are good example of extinct animals is dinosaurs which became extinct along time ago rohu asked his father while the survival of animals became so the focus that they became extinct his father told him that it is because of the disturban in their natural habitat rohu asked if there is any provision and national parks to word this his father told him that straight rules are imposed and all national parks to protect flora and for no human activities like grazing forcing huntingt capturing of animals collection of firewood and medicinal plants at cetera are prohibited in these areas what do you think are only large animals at the risk of extinction now small animals are much more at rest of becoming extinct as compared to large animals but how sometimes we give states frogs leserds at cetera brutally without knowing their importance in the ecosystem by killing them we are using as much damage to ourselves as we are doing to them though they are small in size we cannot ignore their role in the ecosystem they are apart of food chain and food webs here you must recall what an ecosystem is an equal system is composed of all the plants animals and micro organisms in a particular area along with the non living components like climate soil lake etcetera loan asked his father whether there is any record of the endangered species his father told him about the red data book which is the source book that keeps are record of all the endangered animals and plants it is maintained by an international organisation do we have any indian red data book yes in dia also maintains the red data book for plants and animals found in india so we have seen that national parks are large and diverse eras which are created to protect whole sets of equal systems they preserve flora for ne landscape and historic objects of an area south boron national part is the first reserve forest to findia such porataiga reserve is unique as a significant increase in the tiger population has been observed here animals whose numbers are diminishing to a level

Preparation of Soil, in the is and agriculture based country agriculture and india has an extensive background and to day in tea ranks second and farm output agriculture is the signs of growing food crops and other useful plant products different agricultural practices are use nowadays to increase the crop yield and meet the growing demand of human population what do you think is the most important requirement of agriculture of course soil nutrients soil needs to be prepared before cultivation soil if left alone tends to form hard lumps naturally hence it needs to be loosent and turned to make uniform soil particles the loosent soil allows plant roots to penetrate deep into the soil it also allows more air to pass to the roots of the plant so that they can breathe easily which in turn increase the growth of the plants another advantage of loosening of soil is to retain water in the soil in then favours the growth of natural agents like earthworms and microbes in the soil which are called friends of former these organisms help in the formation of humors humus as dark organic material that forms and soil when plant and animal matter decays due to the composition of dead plants and animals by the microrganisms present in soil various nutrients present in dead organisms are released back into the soil since plants mostly take neutrons from the top layer of the soil the turning in loosening bring the new try into rich soil present below the top soil to the surface the process of loosening and turning the soil is called ploughing or telling ploughing is done with the help of a tool called plough which is made up of wood or iron and is driven by bu arcs are attracte in case of very dry soil needs to be water before ploughing the lumps present in the soil are split with the help of or plants the ploughd soil is then pressed with the wooden or iron levellar leveling is done so that the sowing as well as eregation can be done evenly sometimes manure is added before ploughing so that the proper mixing of manure with soil takes place after preparation of the soil by ploughing seeds of good quality are selected and soon in the soil,"['soil nutrients soil', 'soil present', 'top soil', 'useful plant products different agricultural', 'soil', 'nutrients present', 'lumps present', 'output agriculture', 'humors humus', 'natural agents', 'more air', 'important requirement', 'human population', 'crop yield', 'food crops', 'extensive background', 'present', 'plant', 'levellar', 'dead', 'matter', 'organic', 'agriculture', 'lumps', 'top', 'new']"
Pressure Exerted by Gases, you might have driven ar bicycle to school sometimes the basic to is be come flat what do you do in such situession yes in such a situation you compare into the bisecltaile and to inflate but why does this happen this happens because of the pressure exerted on the inner walls of the cube by the pumped into it when the tube is finally inflated it becomes almost and effort less process to write the bicycle similarly when air is blown into or balloon it increats due to the pressure exerted by the air molecules on the inner walls of the balloon all gases are made up of molecules that exert pressure on the walls of its container do you know by the molecules of the gas in random motion continuously clue colliding with the walls of the container thereby exerting pressure one when few gas molecules collide on are given area per unit time pressure applied by the gas is less as compared to pressure due to collision of alas number of gas molecules on the same area per unit time this is because pressure is directly proposal to the force and inversely proportional to the area the can you think what will happen if the gas inside one of the cylinders is compressed by pressing down the piston yes in that case the pressure will increase as the gas container is compress gas molecules come closer and the area of collision with the walls of the cylinder increases thereby causing an increase in pressure the temperature of the gas also affects the pressure exerted by it on the walls of the container when the temperature of the gas is increases then its energy increases and the molecules collide ml usefully with the walls of container thereby exerting wo pressure you must have noticed that when as tin coke is used for cooking then on enough heating the coke vessels do you know why the coke does so the steam coke vessels while cooking the calls on hit in the liquid water in idethe coke gets converted into water winter as the amount of water vapour inside the coke increases the pressure inside the coke also increases after sometime the pressure inside the coke becomes too high that is it pushes out the nose of the coke and the water vapour escapes out of the coke with the wistling sounds it happens because of the pressure exerted by the water vapour on the nasal of the coke so all learning can be summarised as listed her the gas is exert pressure on the walls of its container the continuous collision of molecules of gases with walls of the container is responsible for pressure exerted on it by the gas molecules the pressure exerted by gas molecules increases with increase in the number of molecules within are given container the pressure exerted by gases on the walls of the container increases with decrease in volume of the container and vice versa the pressure exerted by gases on the walls of the container increases with increase in temprature of gas and vice versa the increase in water vapour in ar container of fixed volume increases the pressure inside it,"['gas molecules increases', 'coke increases', 'gas container', 'gas molecules', 'container increases', 'ar container', 'time pressure', 'coke', 'gas', 'wistling sounds', 'same area', 'random motion', 'less process', 'inner walls', 'such situession', 'water', 'increases', 'container', 'time', 'pressure', 'molecules', 'ar', 'collision', 'less', 'area', 'walls', 'such']"
Pressure Exerted by Liquids, you might have experience working on sand if you turn back you will observe that of foot leaves an impression behind it happens because of the pressure exerted by your foot on the sand due to your wet similarly you might have observed workers carrying sand on ar wheel barrow on sandy see bites or river bands if you look closely you will observe that the workers keep of wooden plank between the wheel barrow and the soft sandy ground do you know why they do so they do it to re use the pressure exerted by wheel barrow on the ground so that they can move it easily if there is no wooden plan between the wheel barrow and ground then wheels of the wheel arrow sin can the sand due to increased pressure and waters are unable to move it all the solid objects like your feet or ar whalbarow exert pressure on the ground due to their way to liquids and gases also exert pressure like solids yes similar to solids liquids and gases also exert pressure due to their own we liquids and gases are cold fluids as they have the ability to flow the pressure exerted by at liquid or ar gas is called fluid pressure to understand how like exerts pressure let us perform an activity the materials requatfor this activity are aplastic bottle at glass tube of length around tens anti mature balloon ar candle ar pan and ar match box with the help of or match box let the candle and then heat one of the ends of the glass ti when the end of the glass tube is sufficiently heated insert it quickly near the bottom of the plastic bottle such that al later both of the tube is out of the plafstic bottle to void any liquid of bottle feel the joint us in the baltenvaks of the candle take the balloon and cover the mouth of the free end of the glass to now plays the plastic bottle on the band in the worticlposition and fill half the bottle with bottre you will observe that the balloon at at to the glass tube bulge salt can you tell why this happens this happens because of the pressure exerted by watt on the inner wall of the balloon this means that liquids exert pressure when water is kept in the bottle acontaina it applies the pressure on every point of the inner walls of the container to further understand the pressure exerted by the liquids let us continue with the same activity now pore more water into the bottle you will observe that as the height of water in the bottle increases there is also and increase in the bulge of the balloon but widers this happen when more water is filled in the bottle the weight of the bottle in the bottle increases but area of the base of the bottle remains the same we know the pressure is directly proportional to the words or wait so with an increase in wet the pressure on the als of the bottle as well as on the bottle of the balloon increases which leads to for the balging of the balloon now remove the glass tube along with balloon and will two more holds at same depth in the bottle and fill it with botture what do you observe you will observe that water streams come out of the holes with the same speed and falls at as same distance from the base of the bottle this indicates that water exerts equal pressure at the same det this is true for all liquids but what will happen if holds at will at the ferent heights streams of water coming out from different heights all at different distance from the base of the bottle this stream of water coming out of hole which is nearest to the base of the bottle covers the main on distance and it goes on decreasing with height this indicates that pressure exrted by bottle decreases with height this is true for all liquids these on the above activities we can conclude that lquids exert pressure on the walls of the container as well as front male with pressure to another object like ar balloon attached to it liquids exert equal pressure at the same dead liquipressure decreases with the height,"['anti mature balloon ar', 'ar match box', 'same dead', 'ar wheel', 'liquids exert pressure', 'exert pressure due', 'ar balloon', 'bottle', 'exerts pressure', 'sandy see', 'same', 'exert pressure', 'water exerts', 'wheel arrow', 'tube bulge', 'ar', 'more water', 'liquids exert', 'front male', 'above activities', 'free end', 'heated insert', 'match box', 'cold fluids', 'solids liquids', 'solid objects', 'river bands', 'sand due', 'pressure', 'sandy', 'wheel', 'heights', 'inner', 'wooden', 'balloon', 'water', 'bulge', 'tube', 'more', 'end', 'solids', 'liquids', 'due', 'sand']"

Sowing, yesterday i saw my mother was making or small cavity by digging the soil in the backyard after digging she played some seeds into the cavity and covered it with the soil then she pole some water over it now i wonder what was she doing she was sewing seeds to go plants in her backyard sowing is the process of scattering or placing seeds in the soil it is the most important part of crop production after preparation of the soil seeds of good quality are selected and sown in the soil selection of healthy and good quality seeds plays are very important role in crop production for the selection of good quality seed that performing activity take beaker and fill it half with water now put a spoon full of wheat seeds into it and stir well now wait for some time after some time we will see some seeds are floating at the surface of beaker and rest of them had sank the reason behind this is that the seeds which are damage to become hollow and are thus lighter so they float on the surface of water on the other hand healthy seeds get settle down at the bottom as they are comparatively heavy this is a good method to separate healthy seeds from the damaged ones tools that are used to sow seeds include traditional tool and seed drill traditional tool is shaped like a funnel the seeds are filled into the funnel and are past down from pipes with sharp ends these ends pure into the soil and play seeds there seed drill is ar modern method of sowing seeds it is used by attaching it to attract her by using this tool seeds are placed uniformly at proper distance and depths this tool and shows that seeds get covered by soil this prevents the damage caused by birds it also avoids over crowding of crop lands hence the plants get sufficient water and light and no trains from the soil hence thelection and swing of seeds are two agricultural practices which are very important to get healthy crop with good yield,"['good quality seeds', 'hand healthy seeds', 'healthy seeds', 'tool seeds', 'sowing seeds', 'soil seeds', 'good quality seed', 'seeds', 'healthy crop', 'good quality', 'good method', 'proper distance', 'ones tools', 'spoon full', 'small cavity', 'crop', 'good', 'ends', 'important', 'healthy', 'method', 'seed', 'tool', 'sowing', 'soil', 'water', 'cavity']"

Types of Forces, the door of your room does not open until you push or polect to drink water from aglasupicita the football based on the ground remains at its possession unless the ply optic sect the actions like pushing pulling taking and hitting are often used to describe certain task and can be replaced with as single term called force in science push or pole on an object is called or for fork is on each of the previ it ation and categories them in terms of push or pull the motion imparted to the frond objects is due to the action of or force but when does the for come into action lets find out suppose ball is placed on the table will it move on its own no aboystanding near the table gives up push to it due to which the ball comes into mojion another boy standing at the other end of the table puts his hand in the path of the moving ball due to which the ball comes to rest the boy picks up the ball and squeeze it between its fingers and the pan as the result the shape of the baljinjest the change in the state of an object depends on the magnitude the force and the direction in which the force is applied as for has magnitude as well as direction so it is object to contita so from this activity it can be concluded that for ar for to act the two objects must interact for can change the state of the object for can change the direction of the moving object for can change the shape of the object the above change in state of the object is due to the force applied by the force on the object when the two are in direct contact with each other but is it necessary that for ar force to act the two objects must be in direct contact with each other lets find out take ar magnet and some iron nails not bring the magnet close to the iron nails you will observe that to the in nails are not in direct contact with the magnet they get attract et towards the marbnect lets do one more simple activity take ar comb and rub it with the dry has after rubbing bring it close to the tiny bits of paper what do you observe both the cone and the bits of paper are not in direct contact with each other but still the bit of paper get attracted towards the cm in the above to activities the two pair of objects in each case are not in direct contact with each other but still the force acts with we in them for is classified as contact force and non contact force lets understand each type one by van contact force can you left about with obtaching it of course not generally to apply for on an object your body must be in contact with the object this contact can be made by means of some other object also such as ar rop used for lifting the heavy objects but where does the force needed to lift are most objects come from this force is caused by the action of muscles in your body the for resulting due to the action of muscles is known as the muscular force it is the muscular force that enables us to bend are body parts balso it is due to the muscular for that the land in it are bodies expand and contract while we inhale an exhail not only humans but animals also make use of muscular force to carry out the affisculectivi tie muscular force can be applied only when it is in contact with an object so it is an example of are contact force it is the muscular force that enables us to rate are by sickle when we stop at land the basic gradually slows dun and finally starts similarly are ball rolling around the ground gradually slows down and finally comes to rest in both the situations no force appears to be acting on the object but there speed gradually decreases and finally they come to rest but some force be acting on them yes its the for of friction the ponsible forcing in the state he motion of bob the objects this force acts between the two surfaces in contact so it is an example of are contact force friction opposes the motion and always acts in the direction opposite to the direction of motion of the objec this is the reason that the speed of ball and bicycle whradually decreases and they both come to rest after some time lets now understand about non contact for says non contact for says take to bar magnets and bring them closer you will notice that in one case the pair of magnets attract each other as unlike pulls attract each other while in the other case the pair of magnets move away from each other as like poles repel each other what else have you noticed yes the objects are not in direct contact with each other but still the for exists between them also the force of attraction or repulsion between the magnets all the fore by which the magnet attracts the magnetic materials is a magnetic force you must have enjoyed drinking with the plastic straw take up plastic straw and cut it into nearly two equal pieces with the help of ar thread suspend one of the pieces from the edge of ataper now rubbed one of the free ends of other piece of the straw with the paper bring this rubbed end of the straw near to the one of the ends of the freely suspended piece of straw what do you observe the suspended piece of straw is attracted to words the piece of straw in hand now rubbed one of the free ends of the suspended straw and straw held in hand with the paper again bring the piece of straw that was rubbed earlier with paper near the rubbed free end of the suspended straw what do you notice now the two stars move away from each other this is due to the reason that the straw acquires electrostatic strarge after it has in rubbed with the piece of paper the rubbed straw is an example of at charged body the fus exerted by at charged body on another uncharged or charged body is known as electrostatic force the rubbed straw is an example of charged body as this for comes into action even when the objects are not an contact so the electrostatic force is an example of are non contact force you know that an object in your hand falls to the ground when it slips of your hand leaves and folds folds of all to the ground when they are detached from the tray can this happen without for acting on these objects no which is this force then this is the folds of gravity or gravitational force that attracts any to objects that have mass even though they might be far away from each other gravitational for is an example of are non contact force objects fall to words the earth because it pulls them gravity is not aproperty of earth alone in fact everee object in the universe irrespective of it size exerts he for on every other object,"['contact force objects', 'contact force lets', 'ar force', 'contact force',

Wildlife Sanctuary, how do you feel when you parents punishyou and clothes you in he room you might get uncomfortable and unhappy similarly if we put animals enclosed spaces like in zoo instead of their natural habitat they also feel uncomfortable and unhappy is there any way by which we can protect them in their natural envinement do you know what ar while life sanctuary ears are while life sanctuary is approtected area where hunting and coating are strictly prohibited for the conservation of wild animals thus these areas provide suitable living conditions for wild animals now can you tell what is the difference between while life sanctuary and the zoo while life sanctuaries are like reserve forests where protection and suitable living conditions are provided to the wild animals whereas zoological parks or zoos are the protected areas where animals are kept in special enclosures or ages and displayed for public view in while life sanctuaries some activities are allowed such as grazing collecting medicinal plants and firewood can you name some animals protected by while life sanctuaries well some examples of the animals protected vi vi life sanctuaries are black park elephant golden cat pink headed dark march crocodile and within human activities like killing are capturing animals are also prohibited in while life sanctuaries even then they are not very save because people living in the neighbourhood encroach on their natural habitat and destroy it so we have learned that are while life sanctuary is are protected area where hunting and poaghing are strictly prohibited for the conservation of wild animals the main objective of establishing are while life sanctuary ears to educate humans about the way of treating animals the animals are taken care of and allowed to live peacefully in their natural habitats whereas zoological parks or zos are the protected areas where animals are kept in special enclosures or ages and displayed for public view,"['park elephant golden cat', 'life sanctuary', 'public view', 'special enclosures', 'zoological parks', 'reserve forests', 'wild animals', 'natural', 'march', 'living', 'life', 'activities', 'animals']"

Compound Interest, albertinstin one said compound interest is the eighth on der of the world what is compound interest and why is it so special compound interest is the interest that an invested earns on his original investmend lusall the interest earn on the interest that has accumulated over time to understand compound interest lets first ti alucatsimple in trads suppose you deposit rupees ten thousand in to ar high interest savings account at at ten person simple interest rate for three years the interest you earn each year is ten per cent of rupees ten thousand which equals rupees one thousand in three years you earn rupees one thousand plus one thousand plus one thousand that makes at total of rupees three thousand interest at the end of third year now suppose that you depusat the same rupees ten thousand at ten per cent interest compounded under in the first year the interest you earn is same as the simple interest that is rupees one thousand but in second year the interest you earn as then per cent of rupees eleven thousand these rupees eleven thousand is the original amount plus the interest you earn in first year so the interest earn in the second year is rupees eleven hundred the extra rupees one hundred is the interest opened on the interest of rupees one thousand earn in first year so the compound interest is also usually called as the interest on in trees in the third year you earn ten per sin interest on rupees twelve thousand one hundred these rupees twelve thousand one hundred comes found ten shall amount of rupees ten thousand plus rupees one phousand as first years interest plus rupees one thousand one hundred as second years in trees so the interest earn at the end of third year is rupees one thousand to hundred ten in total you earn ar compound interest of rupees three thousand three hundred ten over ap period of three years were is the simple interest of rupees three thousand earn over ape rod of three years there is at difference of rupees three hundred ten the benefit of compound interest may not seen very large to start red but it can make aperifference over time using our previous example after thirty years you would have accumulated at total of rupees forty thousand in your simple interest account not bad but that same account using compound interest would have of oping amount of rupees one laxeventty four thousand four hundred ninety four that three hundred it is six per cent more money in your account so with simple interest your account balance is growth remains constant but with compound interest your coun balance grows at and increasing red this procedure we have just seen to find compound interest is very land lets learn as shorter way suppose be one is the sum on which interest is compounded annually at ar rate of our per cent per annum then the simple interest for the first year will be given by the formula shown year amount at the end of first year is given by the sum of pea one and say and or you can write it as pond plus be one or upon one hundred on taking pea one common you are left with one plus are upon one hundred inside the brakes this amount will be the principal for second year and we write it as two so the simple interest for second year can be calculated as be one or upon one hundred multiplied by one plus are upon one hundred the amount for second year will be be to plus assitwo on substituting the values obtained we find that to is equal to pond multiplied by one lus are upon one hundred whole square which is equal to petray proceeding in this way the amount at the end of ten years will be as shown year or we can say is equal top multiplied by one plus are upon one hundred whole raised to the pave end where ar is the amount be is the principal or is the interest rate in per cent age and in is the time in years not that the commulatels you the amount tube paid at the end of ten years to find the compound interest subtract principle from the amount its time to check your understanding shared has taken and education loan of rupees seventy five thousand at he rate of eight per cent per annum how much compound interest will she have to pay after two years write the foummola we have just learn on substituting the given values we find that at the end of two years she will have to pay an amount of rupees eighty seven thousand four hundred eight so the compound interest can be calculated by suppracting the lone amount from this amount which is equal to rupees twelve thousand four hundred eight don't forget compound interest also apices to dead and certainly not in a good way the longer you pipe without being interest the more interest it accumulates and the bigger the det to return becomes,"['compound interest lets', 'compound interest', 'cent

Direct Proportion, ate seller prepares ity for two customers he uses hundred mililetes of milk for two customers one more customote comes to the shop and orders ta the th seller at fifty mellitus more milk in the mixture now the total quantity of milk is one hundred fifty mililiters in the same way two more customers come undbyvone at the shop and for every customer he at fifty mililates of male do you see any relationship between the number of customers and the condredty of ml we see that when the number of customers increases the quantity of mi also increases and the ratio of number of customers to the quantity of milk remains constant let take another exumpul were if one quantity decreases another quantity also decreases the amount of wages that the workers of of at re received are shown in retable below let the work awe of workers be denoted by and the amount of wages by by here when the work owes decres the amantofwages also decreases and the ratio of workavrs to the amount of wages remains constant in general if two quantities and be increase or decrease to get the in such way that the ratio upon be remains constant then we say that the quantities and be or in direct proportion also we say two quantities and be or in direct proportion if upon be equal ga or equals kb we are ga is aconstnd we can write von upon be von equals two upon be to equals eight three upon be tree and so on we are be one be to be three and so on are the values of be corpuanting to the values on two eight three and so on of respectively in our daily life we come across many situations we are we see that if the number of articles perches increases the total cost also increases let solve uproblem related to this gas the cost of ten note books is rupees two hundred fifty find the cost of thirty five such note books also find the number of such notebooks that can be bought for rupees six hundred twenty five suppose the cost of thirty five note books is five and the number of note books ought by spending rupees six hundred twenty five is egg lets first make at table for beta understanding as the number of note books increases the cost also increases in the same ratio hence the number of note books and cost are in direct proportion thus upon be is ar constant so the ratio ten upon two hundred fifty is equal to thirty five upon five after simplifying we get vi equal to eight hundred seventy five hence the cost of thirtifive not books is rupees eight hundred seventy five similarly we can find the number of notebooks that can be bought by spending rupees six hundred twenty five for this we take ten upon two hundred fifty is equal to its upon six hundred twenty five after simplifying we get ex equal to twenty five hence the number of notebooks that can be bought for rupees six hundred twenty five is twenty five we now that the distance covered by are cold with ar uniform speed increases as the time increases let solve problem bastomds if it take eight aurs to cover ar distance of four hundred forty at kilometers by ar car moving at unifomsty then a how much distance or did cover in two hours we how much time we de take to cover adistance of one hundred sixty eight kilometers let first make at table for better understanding it is given that the cart eight hours to cover at distance of four hundred forty eight kilometres suppose the distance covered in two hours is ex kilometres and the time taken to cover one hundred sixty at kilometrs is jars since the car is moving at aunifomspe the time taken and the distance covered increase or decrease together in the same ratio therefore the time taken and distance covered are in direct proportion so eight upon four hundred forty eight is equal to two upon egg on simplifying this for egg we get ex equal to one hundred twelve kilometers hence the distance cover in two hours is one hundred twelve kilometres as this is the case of direct proportion the ratio of time taken to distance covered remain same so eight upon for hundred forty eight is equal to why upon one hundred sixty after simplifying this for vive we get vi equal to three hence time required to cover the distance of one hundred sixty eight kilometres is three hours we know that or map is to miniature representation of or very large region the scale of the map is the ratio of the distance between two points on the map to the actual distance between them on the large region and this ratio is constant for ar particular map so this is ar case of direct proportion let solve ar problem related to as the scale of or map is given as one is to twenty lack if the distance between two towns is five centimetres what is the actual distance in kilometes between them let the actual distance between two towns be ex kilometres according to scale one centimetre on map is equal to twenty lax centimetres when the distance increases on map then actual distance also increases in the same ratio hence distance on map an actual distance are in direct proportion thus one upon twenty lax is equal to five upon eggs after simplifying this for eggs we get ex equal to one corocentimetrs or one lack meters as one hundred centimetres equals one meter we know one kilometer is equal two one thousand meters so we get extequal two hundred kilometres hence the actual distance between the two towns is hundred kilometres lets have ar quick re cap

Increase - Decrease in Percentage and Discount, samanta has gone to the market to buy ar birthday dress for per cent while strolling she notice is address that she wants to buy the price of the dress listed on the price tag is rupee eight hundred but the shopkeeper tells that the dress is on sale with forty per cent of this means that the price of the dress gets rupees by forty per cent can we find the actual price of the dress that sa month ants to buy the original price of the dress is rupee eight hundred since we actual price of the dress is forty percent less than the original price this means that the actual price of the dress is rupees eight hundred fine forty percent of rupees eight hundred we already know how to calculate for the percent of rupee eight hundred on solving we get the actual price of the dress as rupee four hundred eightred isn it simple the is assumed that the price of the dress is rupee one hundred forty person decrease in price recrese is the price of the dress to rupee sixty thus rupees one hundred is decreased to rupee sixty now by applind the unit ry method rupee one is decreased to rupee sixty up one hundred and then rupees eight hundred is decreased to rupee four hundred eight hence the decrease price is rupee for hundred eight we can also solved similar problems when there is and increase in percent consider an example at child gets up pocket money of rupees two thousand in am it is increased by eight percent every year calculate the mantle pocket money he will get in the next year the current pocket money is rupees two thousand since the pocket money is increased by eight percent every year thus the new pocket money is carat pocket money plus eight percent of the current pocket money on solving these we get then new pocket money as rupees two thousand one hundred sixty in the earliest situation the dress had he price of rupees eight hundred this is known as the mark price of the product as the dress was on sale sa month had port the dress for rupee four hundred eight this is called the sale price of the product since samantahad port the dress for rupees three hundred twenty less hunthe mark price we can say that there were at the count of rupees three hundred twenty hundredreds so this count is defined as the reduction given on the mark price of an article thus this count can be formed by supporting the sale prices of an article from its mark price this count can also be mentioned as person age of the martprice the is sold the problem to hundreds hundred run sold an article whose mark price is rupee eighteen hundred at is count of thirty per cent find the price at which the article was sold here mark price is rupee eighteen hundred this count person is thirty percent so this count is thirty percent of rupees eighteen hundred which is equal to rupees five hundred forty hence sale price is rupees eighteen hundred minus five hundred forty which is equal to rupees one thousand to hundred sixty now the three capital at worth have learnt,"['less hunthe mark price', 'sale price', 'decrease price', 'mark price', 'sale sa month', 'price', 'pocket', 'person decrease', 'sa month', 'similar problems', 'unit ry', 'per cent', 'birthday dress', 'person', 'sale', 'less', 'year', 'dress']"
Introduction to the Construction of a Quadrilateral, we are has three sticks with which she makes at triangle now she makes another triangle with the sticks of different colours but the same measurement are these triangles the same she observe that the orientation of these triangles is different but the triangles are the same so we can say that are unique triangle can be drawn with three given measurements but what about ar quadrilateral how many many numbnumbers of measurements are required to draw ar unique quadrilateral to answer this question let us perform an activity as quadilatrel is four sided qualitan so take four sticks out of which two are of the same length say seven centimetres and other two are of the same length five centimetres now make rectangle with these sticks this rectangle has been formed with four sticks with known measurements now if we push this rectangle along its breadth the new shape is formed is this new shape ar rectangle now because all its angles are not right angles observe that it is of parallelogram but the lengths of the sticks have not been changed they are the same as in the previous figure again push the new figure in the opposite direction which shape is formed this is again of parallelogram that is different from the previous to figures even now the four measurements are the same by doing this activity you have seen that four measurements are not enough to make a unique quadrilateral but now the question arises can five measurements determine of quadilatral uniquely let us perform another activity you constructed at rectangle using four sticks this time take one additional stick of the length equal to the dagnle of the rectangle and fifth they stick along be are with the rectangle now if you try to push the breadth you will not be able to deformed unless you disassemble the figure it means the fifth stick has ar role to fix the rectangle uniquely it means that you can not make any other quadrilateral with these five measurements so we have concluded that five measurements can determine are quadilatral uniquely now you might wonder whether any five measurements be its sides or angles will be sufficient to draw or unique quadilatrul it is important to note that there are some specific combinations of the measurements of sides angles and tagneles which uniquely determine of quadrilateral some combinations are listed here now you are ready to learn the construction of quadilatrus when the measurements of any of these quamilations are given to you,"['ar unique quadrilateral', 'ar quadrilateral', 'unique quadrilateral', 'many many numbnumbers', 'same length', 'ar', 'new figure', 'opposite direction', 'right angles', 'sided qualitan', 'different colours', 'unique', 'stick', 'quadrilateral', 'length', 'same', 'figure', 'new', 'angles', 'different']"
Inverse Proportion, jack lives in ar town and the sides to meet his friend who lives in anothetown the distance between these two towns is one hundred twenty culmiters if jack drives his car at as speed of thirtyculomiters per hour it takes for hours to reach is twins town if he drives the car at as tet of particulamiters per have he reaches his tens town in tree has and if he drives the car at as speed of sixty culomiters per ar he reaches the town in two avers do you observe any pattern here here we observe that as the speed increases time taken to cover the same distance decreases we also observe that the ratio by which the speed of the car increases when going from tertytofot is three is to four and the ratio by which the corresponding time taken decreases from four to three is four is to three what relation do we do user in peas ratios here we see that the ratios are inverses of each other similarly the ratio by which the speed of the car increases when going from forty to sixty is four is to say or two is to three and the ratio by which the corresponding time taken decreases from three to to is three is to two we observe that these ratios two are inverses of each other now fine the products of the speed and the correspondintime we see as the speed increases the time decreases in such away that the product of the speed and the corresponding time remains constant thus in this case we say that speed we rise inversely with time and time varies inversely with speed in our day to day life we come across were as at situations we are one contityveries inversely with the other for example in filling up apol with water flowing through identical tides the number of pipes to fill the pool varies inversely with time in which the pool is filled up and the time arise inversely with the number of pipes we see that as the number of pipes increases the time decreases in such away that the product of the number of pipes and the corresponding time remains constant thus we can can two that to when two contites and be very in such away that the product by is ar constant then and be are in inverse proportion if we one be to re the values of be corresponding to the values on two of arespectively then one by one is equal to two be two or one upon two is equal to be two upon be one if two quantities and be are in inverse proportion then the can also be reten are shown here now let solve some problems space on inverse proportion in ac company then the members can complete ar project in five mons if the product has to be completed in two ones how many ti members should work on it let the required number of the members be eggs we car table for better understanding as the time taken to complete the project decreases the number of ti members should increase so the number of the members and the time are in inverse proportion and hence their product remains constant thus we have ten multiplied by five equals ex multiplied by two on solving this for ex we get ex equals twenty five thus twenty five ti members are required to finish the project in two mons let solve one more problem six taps can fill at tank in eight overs if only two taps are opened how lone will take to fill the time let the time required to fill the time when only to taps are opened we vi overs now we would the data in tabular form obviously if fewertaps are opened it will take motime to fill the time so the number of taps and time are in inverse proportion we know if two quantities were inversely their product remains constant hence six multiplied by at is equal to two multiplied by vi after solving this we get vi equals twenty four thus two pipes will take twenty for avs to fill the time lets have ar quick re cap of for we have learnt two quantities and be are set to be in inverse proportion when an increase in covers apapotional decrease in be and ice worsa in such amanner that their product remains constant in this case if be one be two are the values of be corresponding to the values one and two of respectively then one multiplied by be one is equal to two multiplied by ba to or one upon to is equal to be two upon be one ,"['ar town', 'apapotional decrease', 'tabular form', 'more problem', 'ex equals', 'equals ex', 'better understanding', 'car table', 'ac company', 'problems space', 'inverse proportion', 'identical tides', 'day life', 'peas ratios', 'same distance', 'ar', 'town', 'ti', 'time', 'ice', 'equals', 'ex', 'day', 'such', 'ratios', 'car', 'distance']"
Parallelogram and Their Properties, gene is taking in apaf with her father she observe some cordilatrul like shapes in the par but she is unable to identify an such this is because is over only with quadrilatrels such as trap sum and kite anger respective property her father tells her la the quadrilatrul that she is uneble to identify is actually apalelogram but she wants to know more about it can help her ingesregad as the name suggests it has something to do with pale lines when both pairs of opposite sides of apadrelatro ar pale then it is called apalelogram here the side be cu is pall to the side as ar and the side cu are is pale to the side bias we have already learnt about isocilistrop am let us form apalelogram using this isocilistrop sum from the vertex draw up appendicular to side dc intersecting it at point now from the point draw or land with joins it to the mid point of side ad now put out the tangled slip this range and place along side this way you will get apalelogramg the same via now we will obtain aplelogramgl the help of an activity using to define tanglapabo red first place one strip horizontally on asheet of paper and draw lines along its edges now place the other strip in slant position over the lines drawn an drotwomor lines along its edges these for lines in close apart relate this is made upof two pairs of pale lines so if we car this closed figure we get apalelogram phase this on another sheet of paper angebl this palelogram as abcd draw its two dagnls and name the point of intersection as or this move further and define vi be elements of apalelogram the palalogram has at to to of elements which are four sides and for angles two pairs of opposite side are ab and dc ab and bc two pairs of opposite angles are angle a an angle angle be an angled four pairs of adjacent sides are ab and bc bc and cd cd and de an ab four pairs of adjacent angles are angle a an angle by angle by an angle sa angles and angled angle by an angle this learn two important properties of apalelogram the opposite sides of apalelogram are equal in ln that is ab is equal to dc and ad is equal to bc the opposite angles of apalelogrm are equal in meas that is angle is equal to angles an angle by is equal to angled to verify these two properties take two identical set squares of angles thirtydegrees sixty degrees mind de gas place these set squares adjacent to form apalelogram are shown he we can observe that in this palelogram the opposite sides are equal in ln an opposite angles are equal in meas to strengthen this idea we consider apalelogram abcd as shown he observe that in tangled bb and cd angle von is equal to angle to be cause these are alternate int dia angles formed by the dagnelbd as transacewith the pale lines ab and dc similarly angle tri is equal to angle for also we by is common to both the trangls thus frangl bb is congruent to tangled cd by by econgruanse trait in then by using cd cd have ab is equal to dc and ad is equal to bc also angle is equal to angles further angle one is equal to angle to an angle three is equal to angle for implies that angle one class angle for is equal to angle to plus angle tray which gives angled is equal to angled we now turn our attention to adjacent angles of apalelogram observe that angle an angle by are int via angles on the same side of the transverse ad formed by the pale lines by an dc so here angle a an angle by form appair of supplementary angles in as similar way we have three more pairs of supplementary angles angle a an angle angled an angle angled and angles this verifies another important property of apalelogram which states that the jacent angles of apalelogram are supplement we will now verify von last property of apalelogram which says that the diagonals of or parallelogram bisect each other this can be proved by paper folding for this take acutout of or parallelogram abcd exactly like the one in the figure now fold the parallelogram placing the points on point ea to find the mid point of diagonal as you can observe that this mid point of diagonal ac coincides with the point or this means that the diagonal bed by sex the diagonal ac similarly the diagonal ac by sex the diagonal bed let us verify this property mathematical mark the angles in the figure are shown here observe that in triangles aob and see odd angle one is equal to angltwo an angle three is equal to angle for because these are alternate in tri angles also ab is equal to dc being the opposite sides of opalelogram so triangle aob is congruent to triangle so di by as congruence criterion thus by using sp sit we have o is equal to oc be or is equal to odd this verifies that the diagonals of parallelogram bisect each other let us have a quick re cap of what we have

to in tides arranges the car sheet of paper and folded fans now names and as all and em as shown here and fold the paper again then an fold the throw the lands from all and em as that the lands met at the folding land no the me can point as and the lane ele and agent so formed are equal now cut the paper along elon and amenthe code attrles so of tin is arranges using ar rule you cangerifa that all the sides of this ranges are of equal measure thus oranges is apodrilatrele with all sides of equal lend oranges is apalelogram also do you know why since the opposite sides of the ranges are of equal lend it is aparlelogram or we can say that it is as petiole as of apadelogram hence it inherits all the properties of opaleloram so opposite angles of arranges are of equal measure and its ragles bisect each other now set the angles from addition of the tagleswusing as set square all these angles aritangles so arombes as on at dine property that its tangles or popengecula bisectles of each

tatangles of arranges by sec by opposite angles now consider apalelogram abcd what the all the angles of the page do gram beam equal it forms ar rectangle or rectangle is of special palelogram with all angles equal by angles on property of acodrilatrel the sum of all the angles of are angle is equal to three angle sixty degrees if we assume that the measure of each angle is an degrees we fangtatmeasure of each angle is an anti degrees thus each angle of or rectangle is or right angle therefore ar rectangle is aparlelogram with each angle as right angle being apaelogram its opposite sides are of equal lend and tangles bisect each other is there any other property of erect angle that apadelogromd as of are necessarily let us find it or lecatthe trangles bc and add inside rectangle

Acceleration due to Gravity, why does an apple thrown upwards come down why does the speed of the applincreased as it comes down it is because the earth attracts all the objects towards it centre with the folds of gravity here or is the centre of the rd and are is the radius of the earth acceleration is produced in the objects which fall freely towards the earth this achilration of freely falling bodies is called acceleration due to gravity it is denoted by g the value of g is taken to be positive when an object falls downward and negative when it moves upward against the earth gravity for this very reason green falls in the downward direction when an apple is thrown upward it goes in au direction opposite to the direction of the folds of gravity therefore it decelerats or slows down however when an apple falls down it moves in the same direction as that of the folds of gravity therefore it accelerates,"['downward direction', 'very reason green', 'direction', 'earth gravity', 'earth acceleration', 'earth', 'acceleration', 'gravity', 'downward']"

An Idea of Speed: Slow and Fast, we often perceiven object to be in motion if its position changes with time in everyday life we see objects in motion it is a common experience that the motion of some objects is slow while that of some others is fast if vehicles are moving on au road in the same direction than by simply looking at them we can easily tell which one of them is moving faster than the other even the same vehicle may move faster or slower at different times but how do we decide which object is moving slow and which one is moving fast the way to find out which of the two objects is moving faster is to compare the distances moved by them in unit time the object which covers the same distance in lesser time is said to be faster the distance moved by an object in a unit time is called speed of the object which in its asci unit is expressed as meter per second lets understand more clearly with the help of some examples suppose you and your friend study in same school considering bus top as he common point suppose you start peddling your bicycle at the same time as the bus begins to move after ten minutes the distance covered by you would be much smaller than that covered by the bus this clearly indicates that the bus is moving faster than the bicycle in a two hundred meter rays it is easy to decide whose speed is the highest one who take shortest time to cover the distance of two hundred meters has the highest speed,"['same time', 'unit time', 'same', 'time', 'second lets', 'different times', 'au road', 'everyday life', 'common', 'unit', 'bus', 'meter', 'speed']"

Components of Forests, have you ever been to ar forest or been on or bile lights of fore if no tied then let take at trip to forest forests are the largest habitats in which ar variety of living organisms such as several plants animals birds insects mitrognisams et cetera right you may also find some rival people living there in aprimitive manner forests are considered essential because they are so of the pen services such as oxygen to breed food fibre medicines timber et cetera do you know what makes forests able to provide oxygen for us well forests provide oxygen for us with the help of an large number of green plants present in it now you may ponder how these green plants are responsible for providing oxygen for this let three codes recall cacteristics of these organisms it is for us in tassels it is are natural process of the plants by which oxygen is released into the atmosphere do you know which part of the body can be compared to the forest well forests can be compared to lungs in our for the function of the lungs is to move fresh here that is oxygen into your fore while removing the waste gases similarly forests help us to breed biturning carbon dioxide in to clean and pure oxygen since forests are green and the provides oxygen they are refer to as the green lungs of first trees in forests also help in keeping the in vanmen cool by utilising the carbon dioxide gas and turning it into oxygen can you differentiate between of forest and apart lets get to know by first defining ar forest so we can define forest as large are of land covered by at dense growth of trees and other vegetation which is or habitat of many animals plants birds shrubs and grasses can we now say that apart is just aminiature of ar forest yes apart is amineature of ar forest can you define the structure of abuilding does it have any levels well yes if we talk about the structure of ar building you can not is the basement different flows and terrace similarly ar forest also has ar particular structure comprising different levels from top to bottom lets understand the structure of ar forest by looking at its we from the top the bronchi part of the trees above the stem is called the end and conso all the trees together form ar canopy the pons having low lens like herbs and shrubs growing under the canopy form the under story of the forest thus the are of two levels in ar forest and these are canopy and under story atherest receives more amount of light while the flows on don receive or lesser amount of light similarly the canopy of ar forest receives maximum light while the and us to ry receives lesser light we can also conclude that then se the canopy lesser will be the amount of light that will penetrate inside the forest to reach the under story plans let me ask a question now at do you think which level of forests per form most for us intesses well it is the canopy because it receives most sunlight as compared to the under store do you know in in dia the forests of states like madepedas are not ill palace etcetera or thicker or denser and those of other poda and job et cetera you must be won ring waters the thickness of ar forest the thickness of the forests depends upon the number of trees present in forest the are can be dense forests as pars forest ar dense forest is at thick forest in which trees grow very close lay in this type of forest the sun is rarely visible through the canopy of the trees making the forest dark from inside in fast forests open habitat is present with plenty of sunlight forests are home to numerous varieties of life forms and are considered biodiversity hotspots because they are rich in different varieties of animals and plants the were inhabitants to forests are microbes fungi plants and animals some important trees found in the forests are sol the same cesium name alas pig her am la bamboo catchner et cetera along with the trees many animals including birds monkeys insects squirrels spiders and et cetera are also found in the forest the forests also have large animals like tigers lines leopards et cetera do you think all the forests have the same kind of trees and animals lets look at the forests found in utrakand and care lying in there the forests of futrakand have conical deodar trees while the forests of cerilla have coconut tree fic tree people tree et cetera so we can say that there is the difference in the types of trees growing in the forests of different regions due to different climatic conditions animals are also important inhabitants of the forest they are heterotrophic organisms they can be of three types these on their mode of nutrition these are herbivores such as deer and sepera carnivores such as tiger and leopard and omnivores such as birds when plants or animals die they are either eaten by scavengers are decomposed by the decomposers fungi and becteria are most important decomposers while visiting any forest have you ever lived or hurt yourself might

tiny insects like ants beetles and many micrognisms that live in the soil convert the dead and decaying matter into dark coloured humors these tiny little features are nothing but decomposes the decomposers are as important for forest as autotrophs and heterotrophs it is mainly because the presence of decomposers in shows the release of nutrians present in det organisms into the soil thus the nutrients are continuously recycled in the forest it also helps in the growth of new plants in the forest since so many processes and actions are taking place in the forest we can call them dynamic

Excretion in Animals, our cities possess sa garbage disposal system in place which maintains clean and hygienic living conditions what would happen if some one never disposes his or her carbide and left over food if garbages not removed regularly from our surroundings than it will wrought and give rise to varies diseases similarly are body produces various types of topic waste products which be eliminated from the body now on we think from where these waste rodcts come from these waste substances are released as by products of whereas chemical reactions taking place in our body excretion refers to the biological process involved in the removal of metabolic wastes red used by the living organisms the organs that take part in the process of excretion constitute the excretory system the carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood is removed from the body through the lungs and the undigested food is expelled out through the process of ejection but what about other waste materials which are dissolved in our blood how they removed is there any mechanism to filter blood blood capillaries in the kidneys filled are laden removed the dissolved waste substances the blood entering the kidneys contains both useful and harmful substances the useful substances are absorbed back into the blood whereas the waste materials are diss in water and removed in the form of urine from the kidneys the urine travels through narrow muscular tubes called ureters each ureter is about ten to twelve inches in lend from ureters uninus pass into are triangular muscular sac known as urinary bladder urine is collected and told temporarily in the urinary bladder when the bladder becomes distended the urinis released out of the body through muscular tube known as urethra an adult human being normally passes about it hundred to two thousand milileters of urine in twenty four hours the composition of urine varies considerably as it depends on various factors urine contains ninety five per cent water and to point five percent urea and to point five per and other waste substances our skin also plays an active role in the removal of waste from the body you must have experienced sweating during hot summer days to to profuse sweating white patches are formed on our clots poticalarly near the under arms have you ever bonded why these patches are formed the sweat contains water and salts these white patches are formed due to called deposition what do you think does sweat serve any other function yes wet helps to cool our body but how the once lies in evaporation let us understand this phenomenon through the example often ordinpot order pots have been used to store and cool water since time immemorial other pots have numerous tiny holes in their walls through which water evaporates and comes and contact with the air these constant evaporation of water keeps the water inside the pot cool similarly sweat coming out of the poles in our skin evaporates and helps to cool or body now the next question that may come into ones mind is that what is the mode of excretion and other animals is it similar or different from ours all wortobrat animals produce nitrogenous waste in one form or another which has to be removed however though we in which these waste substances are removed from the body of an animal depends on the availability of water the chief excretory product of aquatic animals like fishes is ammonia which directly dissolves in water some animals including reptiles and birds excrete as semi solid white colored compound known as uric acid and in human beings urea is the main excretory prodat what will happen if apersons kidneys stop walking due to any infection or injury kidney failure results in the accumulation of waste products in the body this condition can be fatal if not addressed on time in such condition how the waste substances can be eliminated from the body when both the kidneys disfunction are dilates machine which is also known as artificial kidney is used to remove harmful waste products from the blood as most of us know manufacturing of product is not possible without generating any waste the same condition applies on the living systems

Importance of Forests, on twentieth aprol ar virtual tree plan tation day was organise in neat our school all the students were excited but nectar was wanting wires are important for us well yes trees are indeed very important for all of us and our livelihood the sured that you where the pencil and paper you use for writing the food you eat the medicines that cure you all come from forest thus forests or very important for us let this as the patents of forests in our lives first of all do you know for how long we have been using forests for our ness since the in people tated being civilis we depend on forests for us of iv from the air we breathe to the would we use all come from forest can you recol we discuss the forests as habitats for animals plants and livelihoods for humans forests provide food water and shelter to the animals and trial people living there to forests only help humans animals and plants well now we all disagree as forest also held the in van men for example forests prevent soil erosion and can true climate chain if i ask you waters at wanting without which forests or in comple fat will be your answer may be trees which are the most evident components of forest do you know trees are the most important components in the forest why let us understand the importance of trees first of all trees in forsts serve as the green lungs you must be wondering if lungs our present in our bodies then how can trees or green lungs first and for most we have to the car the basic function of the lungs lungs help or body in getting oxygen from the atmosphere on the other hand forests tiles oxygen into the atmosphere trees being green plants for for for us in tassels in this process we take up carbon day outside from the atmosphere and use it to prepare food for themselves and relies oxygen as or by product since oxygen is important for us we can get the best out of this by product and use it for espiration thus we can say that forests maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon day outside in the atmosphere do you see piles of leaves beneath at tree yes very often the leaves on trees when did fall of on the ground and scavengers like and insects milli peas mushrooms beats at cetera wet for such delicious food and absorb all the nutrients from them this occurs with the help of or process paddy com position this process increases the amount of nutrients in the soil also thus we can say that the dead leaves which foul from trees provide adequate nutrients to the fore noise is everywhere whether its traffic some wedding or the general noise but you will be surprised to know that in forest the noise is very less you will only hear the sound of pecots cokos line monkeys and other animals do you know vi forests are so quiet and pleasant it is mainly because trees can the let the sun as the result nice pollution is relies as it ever happen to you that to or to is akin and your mother or grand mother gives you clothes to get truly from pain plots are actulyplants whose flavor buds can provide rely from pain this makes clothes are so of medicinal products so we can say that we are can be arity of plants which can be used as sources of medicinal products for example the name tree sand alve and in cone trees arose for the are medicinal properties can you think of any other thing that we get from trees yes it is world the furniture in houses schools fats are all made from for this food cans from the timber of are for example the sheet on tree is used for its timber apart from medicinal properties and timber we also get pores like honey gum spices medicinal plants ceiling was for the et cetera for example the bar bold tree is used for obtaining gum on the we and the internet we often hear the news of floods one can trulable rains case floods the flat hits the city flat situation becomes grave and so on but do you know forests can help us in preventing flus how lets know put situation occurs when the water bodies receive and unusual flow of fate now in forests when green for takes the raindrop do not hit the ground direct lay the dense canopy of trees intercepts the flow of water the water comes on the ground through branches and lays this ultimately causes the water to flow in to the water bodies steadily forests also help in preventing soil erosion how lets know the roots of trees can bind the soil particles tightly this causes the soil to remain as such we know disturbance in top soil however when trees are not present the soil is naked and top soil is removed causing soil erosion thus it can be concluded that trees help in maintaining the steady flow of water in to the streams throughout the year we now know how important trees are for us still it is often observed the trees are car for various purposes so you might think about how it will affect forest lets undestand how the removal of forests and trees can affectes in ar forest all the organisms are dependent on each other for example we know that green plants prepare food for all the us by the process of votosintersays howbevos are dependent on green plants for their food similarly carnivores are dependent on herbivores for their food this feeding relationship can be depicted by ar food chain so if we look at the food chain we will see that grass is eaten by ar grass hoper which is or herbivore a grass hope is eaten by or frog which is acarnevod and afrog is eaten by as name which is ar second we carnivore similarly many of the food chains are found in forests if any of the links in the food chain is disturbed the whole ecosystem would be affected now suppose only green plants are removed from ar forest what will happen in such a case the heterotrophs will day of starvation as we will not have any feeding options lear it will not just affect the biotic light but also harm the in van men we all know forests maintain the level of carbon do site and oxygen in the atmosphere now what will happen if forest destruction occurs this will increase the concentration of carbon dioxsite and decrease the concentration of oxygen in the year an increase in carbon dioxide can also increase the earth temperature it is mainly because carbon dioxide can trap the heat coming from the sun we all out the future of earth and we all net to find ways by which we can prevent the destruction of forests and cutting of trees so what can we do to preserve or forests lets list out the was of preventing forest to begin with human in devension must be minimised to conserve forest we all must stand up together and prevent the over exploitation of resources for example we stage of paper which is ar small but effective star lets recall what we have learned forests are precious for us and we get various products from forest forests provide us with food medicines wood shelter et cetera forests help in climate control and the prevention of floods forests must be used sustainable belly,"['tree

Measuremt of Time, all of us need time to work to eat to see as to carry out all the daily those of living as time is important for us to organise and structure are daily activities so we often look for it in watch clock mobile phone as well as in the callender gland watches are commonly time measuring devices but what actually is time time is considered as an interval between two events like day is the interval between two consecutive sun rises ar month is the interval between two consecutive new moons and ayear is the interval between the earth completing one revolution and starting another presently we use clocks to know the time but in ancient times time was measured mostly by changing position of the sun some other methods were over glass sun tile and water clock the sand over glass was used by romans in which the are or fade like glass but the basic working principle was that the upper chamber was filled with sun while the lower one was kept empty now when total sand has fallen from the upper chamber to lower chamber it was considered as ar fix time which became a unit for measuring time the instrument sun die was used to determine the time of the day it works on the principle of changing positions of the sun and accordingly the change of the shadow cast by an object mostly are rock fixed at the middle of ar time as the sun moves across the sky shadows change in direction and ten so as simple sun die can measure the length of ar day it was quickly noticed that the dent of the day varies at different times of the year this instrument does not work of the sun set one can see the sun die at juntarmontar in inter as sun tile call some rayon pre in city japot is one of the worlds large sun tiles standing twenty seven meters it can be used to tell the time to an accuracy of about two seconsingepo lot time water clock is another instrument used for measuring time in ancient period the working principle of or water clock and sand or glass are almost similar where sand is replaced by water in water clock with some modifications in its the time water takes are fix time to fall from the upper chamber to the lower chamber and then this time is considered as the unit for measuring time according to standard units second is commonly used unit for measuring time some other units of measuring time are shown here the ancient timing devices were unable to give accurate time duration the instruments that could held them to keep track of time accurately we needed and that resulted in the invention of pendulum clock galileogalilay is believed to be the first scientist to observe the unicharacteristics of or pendulum ar pendulum consists of abortite to as strain the observe the motion of abob and observed that the bob always returns to the position from where it started to swim also the work completes each to and from motion in the same time every time as simple pendulum is made of atihtstrime won end of which is attached to as strong rigid support and the other is attached to are bob made of metal the metal work is free to swing about the sand ture or mean position when as mol force is applied to the bob which is addressed at its mean position then it starts moving from position owe to position as then again owe followed by why and then it comes back thus one oscillation is completed in this manner the time taken for each complete oscillation is called time period if the length of the string is unchanged and if there is no are friction then the time period remains the same such movements are called periodic motions are oscillatury motion athatscientist is the on hygens in sixteen fifty six built the first pendulum clock which provided are more accurate time than the other time measuring instruments the use of pendulum clock has red used greatly in resin times and clocks and rest watches have become the common time measuring instruments the modern day clocks not only tell times rather the helpers in measuring as males milli sec in duration of time cuts is the crystal whose frequency of oscillation is used to measure time the first clocks clock was made in nineteentwenty seven by worn marrison and

Measuring Temperature, when we to to piece of wood and piece of steel at the same temperature the steel feels colder have you ever thought why this happens this happens because steel and out heat away from you finger faster than would what we feel is actually the temperature of our fingers not the temperature of the material but the sense of touches note reliable meter of knowing the temperature of an object as the does not measure the accurate temperature yes its true lets consider when more example to re confirm this fact take three bows fell one bold with cold water the second bold way learn water and the third bold way water at normal temperature the one hand and lowarmwater and another in cold water for about two meets note co hands out from the two bold and ten them bow into the water at normal temperature how does the water feel when you put your hands in the water at normal temperature the hand that has been in the cold water feels woman while the one that was in the wonwater feels cold do you know why it because our senses are relative and hence the sense of tt the temperature sense is on your hands measure the temperature of the water thelative to the temperature of your hand thus you one perception of the feeling of hot and cold base ton tartaric relative and cannot be interested for measuring temperature in scientific experiments before going in detail let us first now wo temperature is temperature as the degree of honess or cold ness of an object the particles of an object that higher temperature move faster as competo the particles of an object at lower temperature like every tisical quantity temperature too has its unit of measurement and that is degree else or degree frenheight but the esiunit of temperature is kelvin the temperature in one unit can be converted into another by applying the simple formula is shown but how do we measure temperature at device cold thermometer is used to measure the temperature of an object do you know that called was the first sites two in pen ten the rudimentary water thermometer in fifteen ninety three he name this devise as for most cope but this instrument was in effective because water frose at low temperature later on in nineteenth seventy fold gabrial farenheight invented the mucurytermometure amuceretermo meter consists of along narrow and uniform glass tube called the stem the scales on which temperature is measured are marked on the stem there is the small ball that the end of the stem which contains mercury in it there is capalartue inside the glass them in what molteregets expanded when the thermometer consent contact with he hot body to commonly use hormometers are clinical termometa the boritratermo meter you must have use the thermometre to measure body temperature during fever such thermometers which are uses for medical purposes are called clinical thermometer these thermometers emfs of ar king which prevents mercury from falling down when it is taken out of the patients mouth so that temperature can be noted down easily there are to temperature scales on either side of mercury threat one is the sense scale and other is the farenheight scale clinical thermometer can measure temperature and range of tertyfive degree celsius to forty to degree celsius or ninety four degree farenheight to one hundred eight degree farenheight fare height scale is more sensitive than seller scale due to which temperature reading is usually taken in far en height remember that before using the clinical thermometer it must be sanitise properly using an anti septic solution and should be given semturess so that the mucore level falls belopetyfive degree senses now to measure the temperature the thermometer should be plays gently inside the mouth under the tongue of the patient after few seconds when the thermometer is taken out the rise in the multry level is observed in the capillary of the thermometre the reading corresponding to the point of maximum rise of multury in the capillary tube of the thermometer is the temperature of the body moltery is at toxic substan and it is difficult to dispose it when termmeto breaks that is the reason that nowadays did you tell thermometers are used which the not use mercury rather it has he censures that is play the temperature of the body in at tigital screen canaclinical thermometure be used to measure the temperature of boiling water no but why the boiling point of water is hundred degree celsius but clinical thermometers can measure temperature up to forty to degree celsius only for measuring the temperature of boiling water or any other object other than the human body you must use he laboratory thermometer al laboratory thermometer is similar in design to a clinical thermometer except that it has no king the stem as well as the bulb of elaborate thermometer are longer when compared to those of the clinical thermometer al laboratory thermometer has temperature range of minors ten degree celsius to one hundred ten degree celsius temperature of an object measured using elaborate thermometer must be recorded while its bull be still in contact with the object do you know why this is because the laboratory thermometer does not have akin to stop the mercury from falling down when it is not in contact with the object as in the case of clinical thermometers but to measure atmospheric temperature neither a clinical nor aliboratory thermometer can be used for this purpose the special kind of thermometer called maxima minimum thermometer is used it has the temperature range of minus forty degree celsius to fifty degree celsius with one degree divisions or minus forty degree farenheigt to one twenty degree farenheight with to degree divisions during the coenineteen situetion amore

Minerals, minerals we all know that earth consists of minerals in abundants the earth is made up of the crust mantle and car these of these layers is made up of different elements and minerals the basic source of all minerals is the hot magma in the interior of the earth about ninety eight per cent of the total earth crust is composed of eight elements like oxygen silicon aluminium in calcium sodium potassium and magnesium the remaining to per cent of the earth's crust is constituted by titanium hydrogen phosphorus magnes sulphur carbon mice and other elements the elements and the earth's crust are usually found in combined state with other elements and are rarely found exclusively these substances are called minerals many precious minerals like gold platinum silver copper mercury in or and titanium are found in the interior of the earth or mineral resources are or most triseless possession therefore these should be preserved for put or generations,"['hydrogen phosphorus magnes sulphur carbon', 'platinum silver copper', 'earth crust', 'triseless', 'sodium', 'silicon', 'elements', 'crust', 'earth', 'minerals']"
Moisture in the Soil, what do you infer from moisture in the soil well moisture in the soil means the presence of water content in trace amounts do you know each type of soil contains ar considerable amount of water its interesting to know that any type of soil contains approximately twenty five percent water and twenty five per cent air well to know the answer let us perform an experiment for this experiment we require ar boiling to you soil sample burner and at testubestand first of all take the boiling tube and add two spoons of or soil sample to ad now mole this tube on a high flame observe the change note small drops of water on the walls of the boiling tube do you know where the water has come from when we heat the soil sample water evaporates from the soil and settles on the cooler portion of the boiling tube thus it indicates the presence of water content in the soil now take out the soil and compare it with the soil that has not been heated what do you observe you will find that the soil that has not been heated is damp and moist while the soil that has been heated is dry and powdery what can we infer from this experiment from this experiment we can easily infer that soil contains moisture now we call the situation when you observe the soil simering on a hot summer day do you know what the reason for this is well it is due to the moisture content of the soil on a hot summer day the water vapours evaporate from the soil these vapours reflect the sunlight irregularly due to which the air above the soil seems to shammer so we have learnt that moisture in the soil means the presence of water content in trace amounts the moisture content in soil is very important for the growth of plants as they can readily ups of water from the soil moisture content in soil varies from vontype of soil to another,"['soil sample water', 'soil sample', 'soil moisture', 'small drops', 'high flame', 'boiling tube', 'cent air', 'considerable amount', 'trace amounts', 'water', 'summer', 'soil', 'moisture', 'air', 'tube', 'boiling']"
Percolation Rate of Water in the Soil, have you ever observed the streets and parks of your neighbourhood after heavy rains the water stagnates on the road as it is made up of concrete and does not allow the water to sleep into the ground on the other hand if you look at the park you will observe that water does not stagnat for a long time rather it moves inside the ground this sea page of water into the soil is known as pulcolation of water we can easily understand this by performing asimple experiment for this activity we require asmaltin can with apart at its water from one side or apevecypipe which is five centimetres in diameter and twenty centimetres in lend now please two pipes martas a and be two centimetres dee in the ground at two different places with different soils soil that has high sand content and soil that is rich in clay and humerus now slowly pure two hundred mililyter of water into the pipes now down the time when you started pouring water and also now down the time when water completely deep into the soil through pipe at now calculate the pulcollation rate do you know how we can calculate the pulolation rate of water in the given soil well the pulcolation rate can be calculated by dividing the amount of water by the pulcolation time let us understand how we can apply this formula suppose in pipe a three hundred mililyter of water to thirty minutes to pulcolate in the soil so the pulcolation rate would be three hundred divided by third which is equal to ten mililita by minute similarly the pulculation rate of py be can also be calculated using the same formula after performing the experiment you will notice that the soil which has high sand content will have high pulcolation rate while the soil which is rich in play and humors will have low pulcolation rate do you know why this happens well with soil having ar smaller particle size which collective surface area of particles becomes greater as the result water will move slowly through the surface of soil particles and the decreasing sides of pores between soil particles also reduces the rate of movement of water through the soil so we have learned that pulcollation rate as the keepalter in determining the quality of soil it also helps in determining the speed of flating in a given area the plcolation rate can be calculated by dividing the amount of water by the pulcolation time,"['high pulcolation rate', 'pulcolation rate', 'different soils soil', 'pulcolation time', 'smaller particle size', 'rate', 'high sand', 'result water', 'same formula', 'asimple experiment', 'sea page', 'other hand', 'heavy rains', 'pulcolation', 'surface', 'different', 'soil', 'time', 'experiment', 'formula', 'water']"
Radiation, we often use the term heat which is the form of inert heat that flows from one place for abodeat to another through some medium or even without any medium lets understand this concept in detail take a frying pan and place it on the flame after a minute touch its handle what do you feel the handle becomes hot even thou it is not in direct contact with the heat sore this is due to the process known as conduction we generally takes place in solids where heat is transferred from one particle to another without any change in their position in this process heat flows from hotter end to cold or end of an object now poor some water in the frying pan after few minutes what do you observe the water in the pan begins to boil this is due to process known as convection which generally takes place in liquids and gases in this process the particles move from their position the particles of the liquid at the bottom get heated become lighter and rises the cold water particles from the top surface being heavier come down due to gravity and receive the heat the process repeats and finally water boils so in both the processes conduction and convection the transfer of heat neat some material medium but is it possible that heat can flow without any medium let see all life on the earth depends on the transfer of heat from the sun what happens when we come out in the sunlight of course we feel warm but heat from the sun cannot reach us either by conduction or by convection as there is no medium such as air in most of the part of space between the earth and the sun then how the heat from the sun reaches us yes the heat comes to us by another process called radiation heat transferred through radiation does not require any medium it can take place whether medium is present or not on standing near the fire we feel hot as the heat reaches to us through radiation what happens when our hot utensil is kept away from the flame after some time it cools down where does its heat go it transfers heat to the surrounding through the radiation process on la and becomes cool do you know that we also give heat to the surroundings yes our body to gives the heat to the surroundings and receives heat from it by radiation in fact all object radiate heat whose temperature is mol and zero calvan when heat falls on some object apart of it is reflected apart may be transmitted and some part is absorbed can you think out of the three parts which part results and the increase in temperature of the object yes the part of heat which is absorbed by the object is responsible for its increase in temperature this is the reason that utensils for cooking food are black and so that the absorb maximum heat from the fire and cook the food faster also it is at wise to where dark coloured clothes in winter because they absorb heat from the sun and keeps us warm ba,"['maximum heat', 'radiate heat', 'radiation heat', 'process heat', 'heat', 'medium such', 'medium let', 'material medium', 'medium lets', 'cold water particles', 'medium', 'warm ba', 'hot utensil', 'processes conduction', 'top surface', 'few minutes', 'hotter end', 'direct contact', 'minute touch', 'radiation process', 'water', 'warm', 'end', 'conduction', 'hot', 'radiation', 'process', 'particles', 'cold']"
Rest and Motion, while travelling on the road you must have noticed electric pools on the road side while watching these from the window of your moving weak the seems moving in the backward direction one after the other do these pole really move in the backward direction actually the poles are at rest and it is your weak which is moving in the forward direction how can we say that just observe which of the two objects is changing its position with respect to time and its original position here it is uric that changes its position while poles remain static therefore we can say that an object is said to be in motion it it changes its position with respect to time on the other hand if the object does not change its position with respect to time and its original position it is said to be at rest further abody that seems to be at rest with respect to one object may appear to be in motion with respect to another object for instance a person sitting in the moving train seems to be in motion to person sitting on the platform while the same person seems to be at rest to its co passenger in the train thus we can say that motion and rest or relative turns and applies for particular object with respect to its surroundings,"['other hand', 'original position', 'road side', 'electric pools', 'direction', 'person', 'object', 'position', 'other', 'road']"
Simple pendulum and clock, clocks and watches are the most common time measuring devices which help us to manage our lives day not only help us to know when to wake up and sleep but also in determining when to eat and play ar clock is one of the oldest human invention it is sa device that measures time intervals some of the ancient time measuring devices are sand clock water clock and the sun tile one such sun tile clock is present at gun the man per in tally during the fifteenth century spring driven clocks were invented but later pendulum clock became popular with the advancement antacnology different types of clocks and watches can be seen nowadays most of the clocks and watches that we use today have an electric circuit with one or more cells these clocks are culed cards clocks the smallest time interval that can be measured with the commonly available clocks and watches is one second as stop work is so accurate that it can measure time intervals even smaller than second but have you have cot how clks and watches measure time the working of clocks is complex but all of them make use of some kind of periodic motion one of the most well known periodic motions is that of a simple pendulum lets learn about it what is the simple pendulum as simple pendulum consists of are small metallic ball suspended by as train from a rigid support the metallic ball is called the bob of the pendulum when the pendulum is at rest it is said to be at its mean position when the bob of the pendulum is taken slightly towards one end and then released it begins to move to and fro in avertical plain under the influence of gravity this to and fro motion of a simple pendulum is an example of an oscillatoreme motion the pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when its bobs starts to move from one extreme position passes the mean position reaches the other extreme position and comes back to its original extreme position the time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time per it lets to an activity to measure the time per et of a simple pendulum for days we need the simple pendulum thread role ar meters scale ar stop watch and marker set up as simple pendulum with the thread that is nearly one meter in lens make sure that the fans are switched off let the bob of the pendulum come to rest at its mean position with the help of ar marker mark the mean position of the bob to set the pendulum in motion gently hold the bob and move it slightly to one side known as extreme position make sure that the thread attached to the bob is taut while you displace it taking care that bob as not pushed rely said from its extreme position allow the back to oscillate and measure the time that the pendulum takes to complete twenty or cilations repeat this activity a few times and recorder observations divide the time taken fall twenty oscillations by twenty and get the time taken for one oscillation or the time peded of the pendulum these the time peated of your pendulum nearly the same in all the cases it is to be noted that ar slight change in the initial displacement does not affect the time per it of the pendulum so on this basis the idea of pendulum clock becomes successful,"['sun tile clock', 'ar clock', 'ar slight change', 'pendulum clock', 'ar stop', 'ar marker', 'extreme position', 'periodic motion', 'time', 'antacnology different', 'clock', 'sun tile', 'ar', 'initial displacement', 'recorder observations', 'few times', 'avertical plain', 'rigid support', 'stop work', 'available clocks', 'more cells', 'electric circuit', 'lives day', 'pendulum', 'motion', 'metallic', 'century', 'human', 'position', 'periodic', 'clocks', 'marker']"
Slow and fast motion, some vacars move faster than others even the same vehicle may move faster or slower at different times but how one can decide about the fast or slow motion of the object this can be decided if the object in in direction one can easily tell which vehicle is moving fast and which one is moving slow with the vehicles move in the same direction the movement of an object can also be termed as slow or fast depending upon the distance travelled by it in a given interval of time suppose as cyclist and abuse driver both starts to move from same reference line one who takes shortest time to cover the same distance has the highest speed and is said to be fast moving object,"['same reference', 'same', 'slow motion', 'different times', 'abuse', 'time', 'slow']"

Soil and its Types, soil is avaluable natural resource it is the home to brilliance of organisms including plants in many animals you must have notice that the soil is not necessarily of the same type every where different soils have different textures this indicates that foils vary in their properties soil texture help in determining other soil properties as well let us see how soil is made up of different sol particles of various sizes these particles can be of four types namely play silt sand and grave out of these play particle is the smallest and sides silt particles are larger than clay particles sand particles are larger than silt particles in sides particles larger than sand particles are called travels or stones the relative amount of these particles in the soil the pens upon the per intra from which they were formed the proportion of sand silt and play in the soil determines the texture of the soil base on the texture the soil is passified into three different tiles candy soil silt soil and play soil sandy soil mainly consists of large sand particles it is characterised pile loosely packed particles with large spaces between them this type of soil can hold plenty of fair but cannot hold much water ploughing is easy in sandy soil as the tries appeasily due to the fast training of water to than dy soil is tri well aerated and light in what however it is less for tile because its particles are composed of amine silicon diopsile the presence of this mental esartalow the particles to get dissolved in water therefore this soil cannot supply enough nutrients to the plants another type of soil is silt soil it usually occurs in river beds as ar deposit it is also called sedimentary soil it consists of the particles of medium sides this type of soil is power bile but it is not as easy to plough as it is for sandy soil in this soil organic materials are present in large proportion due to which it supplies nutrients to plants and large amount next type of soil is play soil in play soil small particles are found in maximum proportion this type of soil as of very fine texture and its particles are very smooth this soil is characterised by very tightly packed particles that retain ar lot of moisture thus its water holding capacities high therefore when wet it becomes sticky and difficult to plough whereas on drying it hardens and forms deep cracks this soil has lesser spaces and is heavy in way there is another type of soil non as lone soil loomy soil as ar balance to mixture of clay sand and silt particles it also has humerus and maxima water holding capacity end loomy soil is ideal for cultivation as it is the most fertile soil let us perform an activity to determine the type of soil based on the extent to which it can be shape for this activity we require three soil samples label be and see now take of fist full of soil from sample remove any rocks pebbles all glass plates from the soil at water to this soil rope drop and need the soil at just enough water as so as to make of ball but make sure that it should not be sticky repeat this procedure for sample be and sample sea as well try to make of ball from the needed mixture for sample be and see you will observe that abal can be easily formed from the sample be now roll the ball of sample on of flat surface and try to make as celender repeat this for sample be and samples as well as cylender will also be easily form true sample be now try to make ring from this celenter for each sample do you observe any difference in the extent to which the given soil sample can be shaped yes the extent to which the soil can be shaped very for each given samples now can you infer the type of soil samples a b and se based on this activity from this activity we can infer that sample a sandy soil as its particles did not bind very tightly sample be is play soil as its particles parity together allowing the soil to be easily moulded in any shape and sample se is lomy soil as it is the mixture of sand silt and clay particles of the given soil samples sample be that is clay soil is best for making status toys and ports soil is diverse in nature without soil there would be

Transfer of Heat, the transfer of heat takes place from a hot body to a cold body here we can see that uncooked food kept on flame for some time becomes ready to eat the transfer of heat takes place from flame to the food due to which the food becomes hot the temperature of food gets lower as the transfer of heat takes place from the food to its surroundings in case of ice and glass transfer of heat takes place from the surroundings two glass due to which ice melts,"['uncooked food', 'body', 'ice', 'food', 'transfer']"
Transportation in Plants, all living beings require food and water have you ever wondered our plants eat and drink we all know that plants prepared ptheir food through the process of photosynthesis in this process wood is prepared in the leaves with the help of carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight the food prepared by the leaves is carried to various parts of the plant have you ever thought from where plants get romaterials for the preparation of food soil is the nearest and richest to of romaterials for plants but how to plants states romterials from the soil plants and or these substances from the soil through their roots however upon worth mentioning here is that is the distance is small energy and raw materials can easily diffuse to all parts of the plant body but the diffusion process wood work is the distances large thus in dissituation of proper transportation system is required for all plants the requirement of energy is different for its different organiser plants do not exhibit movement and the centadedselv enough plants proportion and various tissues has energy need is comparatively low in plants as compared to animals hence the relatively slow transport system can work well in them however it distant resting to know that the distances over which transport systems have to operate can be very large in all trees through part ways our present in plants for transportation plants transport water to all parts of the plant through ar vascular transport tissue known as tile while food particularly glue cos is transported to all parts of the plant through ar vascular transport tissue known as flows transportation is of vital process for plants it facilitates the moment of water and mental to all parts of the plant and thus held in its growth and survival,"['transportation plants transport', 'plants states romterials', 'vascular transport', 'enough plants', 'organiser plants', 'transport', 'process wood', 'plants', 'part ways', 'distances large', 'plant body', 'raw materials', 'carbon dioxide', 'transportation', 'process', 'energy', 'various', 'food', 'large', 'distances', 'plant']"
Types of Soil, soil is are valuable natural resource as almost all things necessary for the existence of life on earth come from the soil most of our food depends on soile it is very find plants and many animals which make up or food it is also home to billions of organisms soil is the uppermost thin layer of earth crust which is made up of soil particles and humours soil particles are of various sizes on the basis of their size they are divided into four groups lay silt sand and grave let is start with the tiniest particle clay which is the smallest and size its particles are so small that generally there not visible under an ordinary microscope silt particles are larger than play particles sand particles are larger than silt particles and size particles larger than sand particles are called cravles or stones on the basis of the proportion of sand silt and play the soil is classified into three different tides sandy soil clay soil and lomy soil sandy soil mainly consists of sand particles with hardly any clay or sils thus sandy soil has they particles in greater proportion than the fine particles and humors it is characterised by loosely packed particles with large space between them it can hold plenty of air but can not hold part water it drives are easily due to the fast training of water sandy soil is useful for the cultivation of coconut and date play soil as the name suggests mainly consist of play particles with very few sand and silt particles thus play soil has ar very fine texture with the little humors this soil is characterised by very tightly packed particles that retain a lot of moisture therefore it becomes sticky and difficles to plough when wet whereas on drone it hardens and forms deep crabs play soil is more fertile than sandy soil and is good for the cultivation of paddy lomy soil is are balanced mixture of clay sand and silt particles along with humors it has the ride proportion of large and small soil particles hence lomy soil is ideal for cultivation this type of soil is the most fertile with the maximum water holding capacity it is ideal for the cultivation of stroberies and pulses thus soil is divers in nature without soil there would be no life on earth many scientists have described soil as the cover of earth and have studied it in a great detail its properties are divers and it enhances the process of diversification of life on earth,"['tides sandy soil clay soil', 'play particles sand particles', 'soil sandy soil', 'water sandy soil', 'soil particles', 'sandy soil', 'play soil', 'sand particles', 'play particles', 'silt particles', 'soil', 'water holding', 'earth many', 'clay sand', 'sand silt', 'silt sand', 'particles', 'particle clay', 'great detail', 'balanced mixture', 'wet whereas', 'little humors', 'fast training', 'large space', 'various sizes', 'things necessary', 'water', 'many', 'sand', 'deep', 'proportion', 'thin', 'natural', 'play', 'clay', 'earth', 'large', 'humors']"
Uniform and Non Uniform Speed, when a body travels equal distances in equal interval of time irrespective of the direction then it is said to have uniform speed are constant speed when a body moves with uniform speed then the total distance travelled by the body in certain time interval is given by the relationship distance travelled equals to uniform speed into time interval when a moving body travels an equal distances in equal interval of time irrespective of direction then it is said to have non uniform speed are variable speed a ball dropped from a certain height is an example of non uniform speed when a ball is dropped from a height on the floor it bounces to certain hide in subsequent bounces this high gates on decreasing hence the body covers an equal distance in equal interval of time,"['certain time interval', 'equal distance', 'uniform speed', 'equal interval', 'time interval', 'speed', 'certain', 'distance', 'equal', 'time', 'subsequent']"
life cycle of silk moth, silk is an important fibre it is obtained from silk moth the silk moth feeds on fresh malbury leaves the female silk moth lays hundreds of eggs at atime the larvae hat from eggs in about fourteen days the larva called caterpillar or silk worm eats day and night and increases enormously in sizes after twenty five to thirty days the caterpillar stops eating and enters the next stage of its life cycle called pupa it first weaves the net to hold itself then it swings his head from side to side during these movements of the head caterpillars secrete fibre made of protein this hardens on exposure to ear and becomes silk fibre soon the caterpillar completely covers itself by silk fibre this covering is known as cocoon further development of the moth continues inside the cocoon which grows into silk moth,"['silk fibre', 'cocoon further', 'silk', 'life cycle', 'next stage', 'larvae hat', 'fresh malbury', 'fibre', 'cocoon']"

Law of Conservation of Energy, the human body is the complex magyincebit the law of transforming the food consumed in to another form of energy like muscular energy that provides the abilrty to perform work such as working running at cetera similarly in case of various machines used in be lily for example or car the energy provided in form of electricity the true or natural gas is use to perform work by them in body above cases energy consumed is transformed from one form to another for performing the desired work but thus the energy get destroyed of to performing wt no be it human body or machines the obey one of the most important laws of visits called the law of conservation of energy at coding to the law of conservation of energy for an isolated system energy can nidderdecree tet nor destroyed it can only be transformed from one forming to another but at is an isolated system an isolated system is that system which thus not or love the exchange of energy or mate with its surrounding at thermo flows can be considered as an isolated system as its top cover or did what come and mirravolts prevent exchange of heat with the surrounding the conservation of energy and the idea of an isolated system sounds habit abstract but it becomes ar lot clearer when understood with the help of some real life examples in the case of occur the carpel with complicate gas see ergy is an isolated system all the energy that can be utilised for the purpose of transport is lobed inside the gas tank in chemical form when the gas close into the combustion gamber from the gas tank it burns with oxygen in be are the chemical energy in the gas is converted into heat energy that provides the energy to pave the car forward not all the energy the car produces moves it down the rod rather many energy of is are involved in the form of heat found and ear drag while some available energy is also used to power things like the head light are conditioning and so on nevertheless if the total enrgial energy in the form of chemical energy of se ergy gas inside the gas tank of the car and the total final energy in form of canetic energy heat energy sound energy ea drag and others are measured then it would be found that the total initial energy is equal to the total final energy this confirms the law of conservation of energy that the total energy of an isolated system is or constant law of conservation of energy can also be verified in case of free for of an object let an object of mars em we drop from point located at height ace from the surface of the are consider two points be anci vertically below the point at a distance of ex and each respectively at the start that is at point when the object has not been released its initial will of city use zero thus canetic energy will be zero by worthy of its height above the or surface its potential energy is mg the total energy of the object at point is some of its canetic energy and potential energy which is ge let at point be at at distance ex vertically below the velocity of the object be we be thus its canetic energy using the quation of motion will be as shown the height of point be above the earth surfacs is each mines at so its putengial energy will be ash the total energy of the object at point be is some of its canetic energy and potential energy which is mg he let at the point see at at distance he vertically below the velocity of the object be we see thus its canetic energy using the equation of motion will be as shown the height of point be above the earth surface is each mines age equal to zero so its putrngial energy will be zero thus the total energy of the object at points is some of its canetic energy and potential energy which is mg from equations one to and three we see that the total energy of the object is the same at the three points be and se clearly it can forms the law of conservation of energy the law of conservation of energy can also be verified in the case of coupled pendulum when to pendulums are tied to or horizontal red in such away that they will not hit each other while swinging then such system is called coupled pendulum when one of the pendulums is alotoswing it is observed that as the speed of oscillation of the pendulum slowly decreases the second pendulum which was initially stationary begins to swing why does this happen it happens due to the transfer of energy from one pendulum to another why thread in this case the energy lost by the first pendulum that was swinging initially is gained by the second pendulum that was initially at rest due to which speed or first pendulum decreases and second pendulum increases by the same amount thus the total energy in this case remains conserved thereby confirming the law of conservation of energy,"['total initial energy', 'total energy', 'system energy', 'energy', 'gas', 'such system', 'pendulum', 'horizontal red', 'distance ex', 'ge let', 'height ace', 'constant

Law of conservation of angular momentum, the law of consoation of angular momentum state that in absence of an external torconabody its angular momentum remains constant or valid answer starts spinning when her arms overhead when she spreads her arms her rotation slows down whereas when she pulls the arm closer to her body her rotation becomes faster this happens because when she stretches her arms her masses at the larger distance from the axis of rotation which passes through her body thus the moment of inertia increases since no external talk is acting the angular momentum has to remain conserved when decrease and moment of inertia the angular speed decreases similarly when she pulls her arms close to her body some of the mass comes near the axes of rotation and therefore the moment of inertia decreases and hence the angular velocity increases can you distinguish ar boiled egg from raw egg by spinning them you can do so by observing what happens when the forces applied to spin them ar raw egg spins slower than aboile egg when given the same amount of tork it is because the liquid particles inside the raw egg gets pushed away from the centre towards the shell and hence the moment of inertia of the raw egg is more than that of boiled egg and it acquires ar lesser angular velocity moreover when you try to stop them from spinning the boiled egg comes to rest with lay but the raw egg starts spinning again if you let it go this is because in boiled egg the entire mass comes to rest as soon as the forces applied whereas in raw egg only outer sl comes to rest the liquid inside the shell keeps rotating and hence egg starts spinning again have you ever anticipated the effect of global warming on the duration of the egg what would happen if all the polarises melts and the water flows into the oceans then duration of the day on the earth will increase initially when the eyes on the poles near the axes of rotation the moment of inertia of the earth is less but when the eye small and water flows and spreads on the earth surface the moment of inertia of the earth will increase in the absence of the external tork the angular momentum of the earth when remain constant and hence angular velocity will decrease this results and longer duration of the day on the earth,"['angular velocity increases', 'angular momentum', 'angular velocity', 'inertia increases', 'angular', 'global warming', 'entire mass', 'liquid particles', 'same amount', 'raw egg', 'larger distance', 'external', 'answer', 'inertia', 'polarises', 'duration', 'liquid', 'egg', 'mass']"

water it contains mere such as and axe at strom sea water contains the solar or we can that sea water is saline in mation but harry to know that the chemical composition of water is always in is pectin of its source let be its ring through the law of axon proportions this law was given by cos of found in seventeen seventy nine the law states that the chemical compound always consists of the sa elements combined together in the same proportion by mass in dependent of the mated by which it is prepared or the sort from which it is obtains there is the chemicapound which is made up of two elements and atomic mass of is go and atomic mass of is by where you is fine atomic masents so mass of an atoms of is ex you and mass of atoms of be is by you ratio of mass of element and element is mass of upon mass of that is equal to ex born in why now take example of water ane what is the molecular formia of water man it is eight to good water is the compound made up of two elements hydrogen and oxygen atomic mass of hydrogen is one and atomic mass of oxygen is sixteen you so mass of two atoms of hydrogen and water is two and mass of one atom of oxygen in water is sixteen ratio of mass of element hydrogen and element oxygen is mass of hydrogen upon mass of ox that is equal to two upon sixteen that is man is to as it ties that water is always found togogen hydrogen and oxygen combine in the ratio of one is to by mass and this ratio is in the pen of the source of water similarly we can find out the ratio of hydrogen and hydrogen in ammonia good children olitulooca about and verify or

Magnetism of a Toroid, the electric pave generated at power stations is very hi and is transformed many times before it is utilise such transformation of alternating current from one voltage to another is done through transformer the transformer can be seen in rectifies volt it regulators woltestibulizes et cetera now the question is what is transformer a transformer is the device that transforms an alternating potential difference of voltage from one value to another value be its smaller of greater using the principle of electromagnetic induction for voltage transformation atoroid is used in the transformer do you know what at toroid is atoroid may be described as as solenoid that has been curved until its through ene need forming he circular ring fa toroid is the coil of insulated or enabled wire wound on ar don at shaped form made up of ferro magnetic material such as iron as the turns of the wire in he toroid are very closely wound so it produces the magnetic field stronger than that produced by as solenoid when an electric current passes through one end of the toroid wire ar magnetic field is set up in the toroid the current from one end of the toroid wire volts through each turn and eventually comes out through the other end the direction of magnetic eld created by atoroid can be well understood by the right hand humrule if you grasped the toroid with the fingers of your right hand curled in the direction of the current in the windings then your extended right come points in the direction of the magnetic field the magnetic field of the toroid represented by the line inside the troid and its direction at any point is tangential to this lid for points outside the toroid the magnetic field is zero as the net electric current in closed is zero to understand the magnetic feld created by atoroid that consider the magnetic field created by each turn of the toroid wire as each turn contributes the magnetic field in the same direction the uniform magnetic field inside the toroid is combined effect of all the turns or loops of the wire the magnitude of magnetic field of ar toroid can be found using the amperes low and is given as where new not is the magnetic anevility of free space or vacume and i in closed is the current in closed in the toroid if in is the total number of turns in the toroid then i in closed is equal to and times aid where i is the current flowing into the toroid therefore be is equal to munot and or be into to pay or is equal to munot and aid where or is the radius of the circular magnetic field inside the toroid and is the length of the closed magnetic low therefore magnetic field inside the toroid is equal to new not and aid divided by to pair if you bring some iron nails near the toroid it attracts the iron nails and they get stuck to the toroid however if you such of the electric current the iron nails fall down this is the cause its magnetism vanishes as soon as the electric currents stops flowing through the coil of the toroid,"['toroid wire ar magnetic field', 'magnetic low', 'magnetic field', 'magnetic', 'electric current', 'toroid wire', 'such transformation', 'right hand', 'ar toroid', 'electric', 'free space', 'same direction', 'other end', 'ene need', 'electromagnetic induction', 'potential difference', 'et cetera', 'many times', 'power stations', 'transformation', 'wire', 'toroid', 'right', 'current', 'ar', 'low', 'such', 'times', 'direction', 'end', 'iron']"

Newton s Second Law of Motion, newtons first law of motion signifies that when an unbalanced external force acts on an object its velocity changes which means that the object accelerates riding or by sic is one of the examples where the change in velocity that is acceleration depends on the muscular force applied by your legs on the pedals of the by site but how does the acceleration produced in an object depend on the applied force lets understand this through some observations from our everyday lies during the game of table tennis if the ball hits apple it does not hurt him on the other hand if ar fast moving cricket ball hits as spectator watching ap cricket match it may hurt him ar bus at rest does not require any attention when parked along the roadside but ar moving bus even at speed as low as for meters per second may kill apposon standing in its path ap bullet has a small mass but when it is fired from ar gun it can kilo person it is clear from all the observations that the effect produced by the objects depends on to fact as one there mass and too there velocity but is there any physical quantity which can combine the mass of the object with its velocity yes its momentum introduced by so isacnetum the momentum pea of an object is defined as the product of its mass em and velocity we that is be equal to min to we as the applied unbalanced force on an object brings ar change in the velocity of the object it is therefore clear that ap force also produces ar change of momentum to understand this let us imagine as situation in which apart with at dead battery is to be putiot along astraight road to give it as speed of one meet per second which is enough to start its indium if an unbalanced force is applied by one or two persons giving as sudden push the car hardly starts but acontinuous push over some time results in a steady acceleration of the car to this speed it means that the change of momentum of the car is not only determined by the magnitude of the force but also by the time during which the force is exerted so it can be concluded that the force necessary to change the momentum of an object depends on the rate at which the momentum is change this is newton second law of motion which states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of force suppose in ashopping mol ap person applies ap constant force on ar trolley of mass em which moves along astricht line with an initial velocity the trolley is uniformly achelratec to willosity we in time t by the applied constant force ef through the time th the initial and final momentum of the object will be be one is equal to new and pea to is equal to em we respectively the change in momentum is directly proportional to pea to min as be one which can also be expressed as mass multiplied by change in velocity the rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to mass in to achange in velocity divided by time the all the applied force is expressed as shown where car is the proportionality constant if car is equal to one then force is equal to multiply by aid hence the second law of motion gives us amethod to measure the force acting on an object as approduct of its mass and axelaratium nutansecond law of motion has many applications in our everyday life lets discuss ape of them you might have noticed that while catching the fast moving cricket ball ar fielder in the ground gradually pulls his hands backwards with the moving ball do you know why in doing so the fielder increases the time during which the high will ocete of the moving ball decreases to zero thus the acceleration of the ball is decreased and therefore the impact of catching the fast moving ball is also reduced but if the ball is stopped suddenly then its high will of city decreases to zero in ar very short into well of time thus the rate of change of momentum of the ball will be large hence alarge force would have to be applied for holding the catch that may hurt the palm of the fielder in ar high jump athletic event the at leads are made to fall either on ac cushioned bed or on as sand bed do you know why this is to increase the time of the athlete fall to stop after making the jump this decrease is the rate of change of momentum and hence the force,"['ap constant force', 'ar high jump athletic', 'ap force', 'cricket ball ar', 'unbalanced external force', 'constant force', 'unbalanced force', 'ap cricket', 'force', 'ar', 'ap', 'nutansecond law', 'second law', 'first law', 'cricket ball', 'velocity changes', 'sand bed', 'many applications', 'astricht line', 'steady acceleration', 'astraight road', 'dead battery', 'physical quantity', 'small mass', 'other hand', 'table tennis', 'time', 'push', 'momentum', 'everyday', 'velocity', 'high', 'second', 'jump', 'constant', 'bed', 'mass', 'acceleration', 'ball']"
Newton s Universal Law of Gravitation, you must be aware of the fact that gravity was discovered by ar famous this is is are isactnuten when he saw an apple falling from the tree the earth attracts the falling apple but does the apple attract the year yes at coding to newtons her law of motion the apple does attract the year then vi can we notesjecttraction of earth towards the apple because according to the second law of motion for at given for acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of an object the mass of an apple is negligibly small compared to that of the earth so we do not see the earth movntowards the apple the on the strand this in detail as we know that the exceleration teduce in an object due to gravitational pull obtheeart on it is nine point at meter per second square as this acceleration is very large we can see the object falling towards the earth tut when the gravitational pull of is seen radius as one liter of mass six into ten to the pave twenty four kilogram the acceleration produced in the ear is one point six three into ten to the pavabanas twenty for metre per second square as this valley of atleration is to small so we can of see the earth moving towards the falling object on the basis of of objections you must have on the to that to wide ear is not most towards the moon or all the planets in our solar system go round the sun there ex this up force between the earth and the moon and between the fan and the planets from the above facts net in an tied that not only does the ear attract and apple and the moon but all objects in the universe attract each other this force of attraction between objects is called the gravitational for the gravitational force is always attractive and the tens only on the masses and vol and the this tens between them considering this surisacnution propose this gravitational law which tentative object in this universe attracts every other object with the force that acts along ar line joining their enters of mass the force is are lyte posnal to the father of their masses and inversely propose ones to the square of distance between them from newtons third law of motion the made use of force is same on each object here the is called universal gravitational constant which does no depend on the mass of the two attracting objects new tens law of gravitation is applicable to all the objects in is universe having mass so this law is called universal law of gravitation let us now find the gravitational force between the light objects and the heavy objects suppose two objects each of mass one ulogra are sepreted by at this tens of one meter the gravitational force of attraction they is ecor to dee von and to the videdby or square or ex ecor to get multiply by one ulogram into one culogran divided by one meter square which implies is equal to gain hence universal gravitational constant is one merry tally equal to the gravitational force of attraction between two objects at of unit mass tet to one metre apart from each other the valley often for an by an recravinition by using as sense valent this extremely small value indicates that for every pair of two objects exert gravitational pull on each other still they cannot move towrds each other the cause this gravitational pull is to we to overcome the frictional force between the objects and the ground let us now calculate the gravitational force when elite object has mass of one kilogram while the heavy one is earth the mass of the earth is six into ten to the pave twenty four kilogram and its radius is six point for into ten to the pave six meter the gravitational force of attraction between the big and the object is nine point newton this shows that earth exerts or gravitational force of nine point at newton on an object of mass one tea which is mucilabter compared to the force when for the objects are liter this is the reason that when an object is fro framahaitit falls towards the earth now suppose for the objects sobheavy one is the earth while other is the moon the mass of the moon is seven point for into ten to the pave twenty to to to grass and tract of earth is six into ten to the pave twenty four clogrand the this tens between them is three point at for into ten to the pave eight meter the gravitational force between earth and moon is two points zero and into ten to th pave twenty newton which is very large it is this gravitational force exerted by the earth on the moon which makes the moon to revolve around the but divided newton assume in volt square dependence on distant in his law of gravitation he was helped by kept us heart la let see how newton found that the lidicity of orbits of planets around the sun is small therefore orbits of the planets can be taken more or less as circular orbits the force required to maintain the planet in circular orbit is the centripetal for if newton postulated that this force is provided by the plavitational pull of sun on the planet if m is the mass of the planet moving with the speed we in a circular orbit of radius our around the sun then the centripetal force is equal to gravitational cal if that is if equals to mve square divided by or if th is the time period of revolution of the planet is equal to time taken by planet to complete one revolution tent equals to distance covered in on revolution divided by sp is

Pythagoras Theorem, over two thousand years ago there was an am sin disc of free about triangles when triangle has at right angle then the square of one side added to the square of the other side is equal to the square of the hypotoniles in other words asqured plus bsquared equals csquared it is called the pitangras terum it is one of the most fundamentrules of geometry and the basis for practical applications by calculating the shortest distance between two points and in construction to ba show that the buildings as square the terum is named after pit agrus agreek philosopher and mathematician in the sixth century bc is the there true for every right angle triangle yes because we can prove are the patagrusterum has more than three angled and fifty proofs one of them is the classic proof given by the patagorus himself by we arranging for identical rightriangles with sitglents a and b and hypotonic another prove comes from or fellowgreek mathematician uk led by using the concept similarity of triangles before writing the proof let talk about similar triangles in are right triangle if apopengdicular is drone from the votics of the right angle of are right triangle to the hypotenus then triangles on both sides of the perpendicular are similar to the whole triangle and to each other let tri to prove this terum now we are given ar triangle bc right angle at b with altitude b d we need to prove three similaritcatemens first triangle b b similar to triangle bc second triangle b dc similar to triangle bc third triangle b b similar to triangle b bc can you prove this wisimilarity criterion will you use still thinking lets find out in triangles b b and bc angle ab b an angle bc are right angles and angle a is common in both triangles so triangle d bisimilar to triangle bc by aa similarity criterian can you prove the second similarity statement now lets how you can do thes in triangles be dc and bc angle c b b an angle bc are right angles and angles is common in both triangles so triangle b dc similar to triangle bc by similarity criterian from first and second similarity statement you can cat boat triangles b b and b bc as similar to triangle bc hence the are similar to each other by using the non tract that one polygon is similar to another polygon and this second polygon is similar to at third polygon then the first polygon is similar to the third polygon how will you use this terum to proof patangrus terum let move ahead to fringes patagreserum states that in ar right angle triangle the square of the hypotenus is equal to the sum of the squares of the other to sides lets gets started with its proof now we are given at triangle bc right angled at be we need to prove that ac square equals bsquard plus bc squared to prove this we dto draw apopendicilar b b from bto ac now we know that triangle b b similar to triangle bc which property of similar triangles skangou use here since or result is related to the site of triangle bc so we will use the property tedto sides only we know that cos pond in sags of similar triangles are proportionle so dy upon b equals b upon ac this can be reitenas bsquared equals dmal to triby ac lets name this as equation von again we know that triangle b bc similar to triangle bc can you write an equation similar to equation one for these triangles as well what are you thinking of course you can since triangle b dc similar to triangle bc so dc upon bc equals bc upon as this can be rewritten as bc squared equals as multiplied by dice lets name this as equation to we are really close don

Refractive Index, let us play asmall game can you guess how many beakers are visible in the picture one but surprisingly there are two beakers do you know why the beaker was in visible what is the concept behind the in visibility of beaker it is because of refractive index of material let us perform an activity to on the stand about refractive index materials require or vegetable oil alarge borosilicate beaker asmall borosilicate beaker and an ordinary glass rod take the small brusilicate beaker and put it in the large beaker now pole the vegetable oil inside the small beaker and let it spell over keep boring the ol till the small beaker gets completely immersed in ol it is seen that the small beaker vanishes the ordinary glass rod can be used to show that there is no trick behind this activity while performing the same activity with the water instead of oil we will see that the small beaker does not disappear inside the water then why does the small borusilicate beaker becomes invisible in vegetable oil it is because of the refractive index of material the refractive index of amaterial is defined as the ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in the material refractive index tells us about the optical density of amaterial medial it is just the number and has no units higher refractive index of amaterial means the speed of light is less in that material and wiseversa for an object to be com truly invisible from any viewing angle it must not reflex refract or absorb incident light to achieve this the object must be made of atransparent substance with the refractive index that perfectly matches that of the surrounding fluid the burusilicate glass beaker completely disappears when vegetable oil because borosilicate and vegetable oil have the same refractive index which is equal to one point for seven the beaker does not completely disappear in water which is water as a deferentrefractive index that is equal to one point three three ordinary glass does not disappear in vegetable oil with is ordinary glass as he different refractive index which ranges from one point fight to one point seven try to find out about materials having same refractive index and perform the great activity,"['borosilicate beaker asmall borosilicate beaker', 'higher refractive index', 'same refractive index', 'glass beaker', 'small beaker', 'refractive index', 'beaker', 'same activity', 'incident light', 'amaterial medial', 'optical density', 'many beakers', 'glass', 'index', 'asmall', 'borosilicate', 'small', 'activity', 'oil', 'light', 'amaterial', 'beakers']"
Total Internal Reflection, ar diamond is well known for its outstanding brilliance its brilliant is due to the fact that when the ray of light enters the diamond it reflects multiple times before coming out of the diamond but do you know how light ry entering into ar diamond suffers multiple reflections the light ray suffers multiple reflections do to phenomenon called total internal reflection one ring what it is to one is tan the phenomenon of total internal reflection lets perform an activity the materials required ar ar laser pointer ar glass tank filled with water some milk and the stirrer said the tank at the end of the table shine the beam from side of the tank such that it strikes at the upper water surface on observing carefully to laser spots can be seen one on the roof and other on the table or do you think these pots indicate to know let at the few drops of milk into the water and stir to make the water are little turbid now if you can shine the laser beam you can see the path of light inside the water simple showing the reflection of light while the spot on the roof suggests apart of the refracted light thus it is concluded that the light while travelling from water to air tet partially reflected that into the water non as internal reflection and get partially refracted into the air what will happen if you keep increasing the angle re incidents of the laser beam yes ap point will come when the light tray will not refractinto the air instead it will traverse along the surface of the water now imagine an normal drawn through the point of incidents at the interface of the two media the angle of incidence from which the angle of refraction becomes ninety degrees is called critical angle for the given pair of media can you guess what al happen if the angle of incidence is further increase yes the light beam will not refraction the irat all and get completely reflected back within the water this phenomenon of complete reflection of light back into the denser medium is called total internal reflection lets now understand the mathematics behind it here water is medium one in which light first enters and air is medium to in which light exerts from snails law that is sin eight divided bigesine are is equal to relative refractive index end to one for critical an gal it becomes sign eye see divided by signeninety degrees equal to end to one since light ray cannot be code refracted beyond ninety degrees thus there is an upper limit to the value of sin eye for which the law can be satisfightthat is is equal to eye see such that sin is is equal to end to one hens beyond critical angle the light will suffer the total internal reflection do you think you can observe the phenomenon of total internal reflection of the laser beam is incident from top of the tank now so from the above observations two conditions can be concluded for total internal reflection to take plays and what are these one the angle of incidence mast be greater than the critical angle and second the light must travel from ar denser medium to or rarer medium do you know the phenomenon of total internal reflection can be observed in nature as well one such phenomenon is mirage on hot summer especially in deserts while sitting in side or are you might have observe that the rod ahead is wet or you may find an inverted tree on the road sight but as you come closer to we rod and the inverted tree just disappears wonder how it happens lets understand how exactly it happens on hot summer days the land heats the air closer to it while the air at the higher levels is relatively cooler since hot air is less dense than the cool air the refractive index of air increases on moving from mate to top when the light from the tree passes through ar medium whose refractive index decreases towards the ground its successively bends away from the normal finally it incident at an angle larger than the critical angle for the air near the ground resulting in total internal reflection and enters the eye of the observer to the observer the light appears to be coming from somewhere below the ground as the result the observer naturally assumes that light is being reflected from the ground in the same way and at the same time the reflection of the sky is also seen there which appears as pool of water resulting in a mirage now lets get back to our experimental set up and make a small circular hole on one side of the tank from where light is going out of it what do you observe yes light is suffering total internal reflections even in the flowing water this is exactly how light travels inside an optical fibre when he signal in the form of light is directed at one end of the fibre at he suitable angle it undergoes repeated total internal reflections along the length of the fibre and finally comes out at the other end having negligible loss in the intensity of light optical fibres are the bag bone of to days communication at works and have held in advancement of medical sectors as well another application of total internal reflection is specially designed prisms which can bend light by ninety degrees all by one eighty degrees ap pair of forty five degrees prism is used in ar prismatic binocular to see brighter image of the objects now you can also understand the reason behind the brilliance of a diamond the critical angle for diamond air interfaces twenty four point four degrees this angle is very small and therefore one light enters the diamond it suffers total internal reflection inside the diamond but if you will see an natural uncatiamond it will not exhibit as much brilliance as compared to finish diamond do you know why a finish diamond has more brilliance because by cutting the diamond suitably it is given a shape which results in multiple total internal reflections to ace,"['ar ar laser', 'light optical', 'light first', 'diamond air', 'degrees ap', 'ar diamond', 'hot air', 'refractive index end', 'ar medium', 'angle re',

Artificial Vegetative Propagation, you must have seen certain plants which bear plants with different colods for example these rose plant it has red as the as white colored plants how is this possible that the single plant can produce plants of two different colours what do you than can this happen actually certainly not it is possible by the means of artificial wegetative propagation some tension tin horticulture is have been using this method to produce different varieties of plants let us explore artificial vegetative propagation in detail well artificial vegetative propagation is appropagation method that is accomplish through artificial means by involving human intervention it is important to know the words human intervention which simply means the many polation of plant genes by humans some of the most common methods of artificial vegetative propagation are cutting grafting and plant tissue culture let us understand the first and that is cutting well as the name suggests in this method are part of stem root or leaf is cot and is then used to produce an new plant it is of very simple method but how is the tan let us understand for cutting ar healthy green them is cut from the mother plant the piece of the stem should be twenty to thirtysentimetors long and it should also have at least three to four notes now you must be thinking win not so important nodes are part of or plants stem from which leaves planes and areal roots grow they are the site of meristem mataic activity the hot plants which can grow into leaves flars or other stems therefore always remember that cut should be just below the note of the stem at an angle of forty five degree now the cut stem is gently planted in the part and waterd after few days cutting develops ros and grows into one new plant canithink of the reason because of which the stem is cat at an angle of forty five degree cutting the stems at an angle of popty five degree and shows that are plant has cot more urfesaria to absorb water and exchange of gases now can you mean any plant which propagates by stem cutting yes you guess the right rows and sugar gain are propagated by this method we have learnt about the simplest to method of artificial propagation but what do we do if we need to combine the best characteristics of two plants well in this case we will choose another method that is grafting in graft en the stems of two different plants are joined together so as to produce the new plant containing the carters of both the plant from which the roots of sum is taken is called stock while the other plant from which the so the selected is known as sin or graft but the question as on what besids it is decided that which plant will act as stack and which plant will actors graft well out of the two plants the plant which has of stronger root system is usually taken as stock while the plant which has better flower or froteans is taken as sin or graft some common plants produced by grafting are apple beach bear et ceteratnow can you tell which method will ou use if ewanttoproduse thousands of plant lids from atiny plant of plant in very less time in such condition at the ferent method of vegetative propagation is use that is plant tissue culture it is the method of propagating large number of plants from as single plant in short time under laboratory conditions in this method tissue from the growing part of plant such as leaf band or anther is taken for growth the plant tissue is then placed in nutrient medium under sterilised conditions the tissues grow into small mass of cells called colours the callus is then counter in apormon containing medium and it eventually develops into plantlets the developed plantlets are trans or to soil which later on develop into fully grown plants so by this method we can get many plants from at tiny part of plant this tick nice is commonly used for ornamental plants such as or cats now can you train list some of the benefits of artificial vegetative propagation well artificial propagation allows us to adapt and improve plants for our own use its other benefits are quit production of large number of genetically identical plants specific varieties with desired features or consistent quality are obtained special characteristics such as hardness drought tolerance or disease resistance can be introduced but as each coin has two sides it also has certain disadvantages the plants obtained through artificial vegetative propagation are genetic clones of the parent plant the amount of genetic variation between them is extremely low hence all the plants are equally susceptible to the same plant virus and other pathogens that can destroy the entire crop,"['plant such', 'other plant', 'plant tissue', 'different

Characteristics of Chemical Reactions, believe it or not we are chemicals surrounded by chemicals and using chemicals and we everything we use and eat is made of different chemicals many at times chemicals react with each other to make new substances for example turning of milk rusting of in burning of wood fermentation of grapes digestion of food in our body and respiration when chemicals react and form one and more new substances it is set that ar chemical reaction has taken place in achemical reaction the chemicals which iniiate the reaction are known as reactans and the substance or substances formed and the end of the reaction are known as products for example during burning of wood the carbon present in wood react with oxygen and forms carbon dioxide in this reaction carbon and oxygen or reactants whereas carbon dioxide is the product let us perform ar few activities to know if the chemical reaction has taken place or not for this activity we need as spirit lamp with are match box as strip of magnesium ribbon of what glass and appear of tons first lit this pure lamp with the help of or matte now pole the strip of magnesium ribbon with the help of pair of tongs and bring it to the flame we observe that the magnesium ribbon burns with ar dazzling white flame when the magnesium ribbon completely burns or white coloured substance is formed do you know what it is the white coloured substance is magnesium oxide magnesium oxide is formed by the reaction of magnesium metal and oxygen and it is completely different from the magnesium and oxygen now we will perform another activity which involves the reaction of potassium iodide and let nitrate solution mixed both the solutions in at taste and allow them to react we observe that ar yellow colour precipitate of led iodide is formed at the bottom of the test now let us perform another activity for performing this activity we take fus in granules in aponical flask and possome dilute sulphuric acid to in we observe that bubbles of hydrogen gas are formed and the temperature of acid having zinc granules increases do you know how can we can formed that the evolved gas is hydrogon lets find when we bring or burning mastic at the mouth of glass tube the gas started burning with box on how can we can form that ar chemical reaction has taken place simple by observing change in state and change in colour as observed in the reaction of potassium iodide and let night rate or by evolution of agas and change in temperature as observed in the reaction of zinc metal and dilute sulphuric acid were is chemical reactions taking place around as candicatic arise as combination reaction the composition reaction displacement reaction double displacement reaction oxidation and red action reaction,"['ar chemical reaction', 'reaction carbon', 'chemical reaction', 'action reaction', 'reaction', 'ar yellow colour', 'ar few activities', 'magnesium metal', 'dilute sulphuric', 'zinc granules', 'zinc metal', 'nitrate solution', 'potassium iodide', 'white flame', 'match box', 'grapes digestion', 'example turning', 'carbon', 'chemicals', 'magnesium', 'lamp', 'wood', 'new', 'chemical', 'granules', 'colour', 'ar', 'box', 'iodide', 'white', 'flame', 'glass', 'example', 'place']"
Chemical Equations, chemical equation is the symbolic representation of chemical reaction the representation of he chemical reaction with the help of chemical symbols and former ly of substances involved in it is called chemical equation let us take an example to understand the meaning of chemical equation clearly hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water now we can change this wordequation into ar chemical equation by writing the symbols and formally of the various substances in quace of their names in this chemical equation the substances on the left side of the equation are called reactions and the substances on the right side are called products plus sign is written between two reactions or products an arrow separates the reactins and prodoxand order to show the direction in which the reaction as taking as let us count the number of atoms of oxygen and hydrogen on both the sides of the equation the number of atoms of hydrogen is to on the reacting side and to on the product side similarly the number of atms of oxygen is to on the reacting side and one on the product side it means that the number of atoms of oxygen is not the same on both sides therefore this is an unbalansd chemical equation such achemical equation is known as schelital chemical equation or he reaction according to the law of the consuation of mars the number of atoms of each element must be equal in reactants and products therefore the equation must be now again down the number of atoms of hydrogen and oxygen on both sides this time there are four hydrogen atoms on the reacting side and for hydrogen atoms on the product side to oxygen atoms on the reacting side and to oxygen atoms on the product side therefore this as the balanced chemical equation here ge and ll in bracket are the physical states of the reactants and products ge stands for gaseous state and he stands for liquid state,"['chemical equation', 'chemical', 'hydrogen atoms', 'products ge', 'physical states', 'prodoxand order', 'various substances', 'former ly', 'symbolic representation', 'side', 'state', 'equation', 'atoms', 'hydrogen', 'ge', 'products', 'substances', 'representation']"
Corrosion, statueof liberty made from copper was originally brown in colour when brought to us say in eighteen eighty six but to day it looks bluish green how did its colour change it happened due to ar phenomenon called corrosion when as surface of metal is attacked by air moisture or ar chemical substance the metal is said to be corroded this phenomenon is known as corrosion are beating of metal metals like aluminium copper silver and iron corrode easily aluminium article lose their shine and become tall soon this is due to the corrosion of aluminium metal when exposed to moist air aluminium reacts with oxygen present in the air to form at tin and dull yr of aluminium oxide on its surface due to the formation of this dull air the aluminium articles lose their shine green colour deposits are seen on the copper roots or copper metal tubes when exposed to carbon dark side and water present in the air this is called catenation of copper these deposits are of basic copper carbonate which is formed by the reaction of copper with carbon dark side and water present in the air led also corrodes or wide deposit of basic led carbonate is formed on the surface of lead when it comes in contact with moist air not is that the articles and due re made of silver turn blast when kept in open for some time silver metal tarnishes in presence of hydrogens of fit gas present in the air and or blast coating of silver sulphide can be seen on its surface on the contrary the gold and platinum articls retain their shine even after several years because they are resistant to corrosion they are highly unreactive metals and remain unaffected by oxygen water vapour and other gases present in the atmospheir due to their unreactive nature gold and latin are used for making jery sometimes are layer of reddish brown material is seen on the surface of iron articles this is known as rust and the roses of its formation is called rusting rusting can be defined as the slow oxidation of iron by the atmospheric oxygen in the presence of water or moisture it is the most common form of corrosion remember while the other metals are said to corrode iron is set to rust iron when exposed to moist air react with oxygen and water to form hydrated iron oxide the hydrated iron of side is called rust and it is reddish brown in colour some factors in trees the rate of rusting presents of gases like carbon dark side oxides of sulphur and nitrogen in the air increases the rate of corrosion rate of corrosion of metals can be decreased by keeping metals isolated so as to avoid direct contact with air the necessary conditions for rusting of iron are the presence of air and water or moisture how can we prove that air and water are necessary for the rusting of iron let us find it out by performing an experiment for this we require three test tubes are test tube stand three iron nails rubber co and hydrascalcian chloride oil boiled water and normal water these three testubes in atestubestaon and label them as air by and say put one iron nail in eighth of them in testubea add boiled water and then poor are little oil in to it in the testubeb add and hydrascaltion cloride and close its mouth with the rope cork in the testubesy at normal water keep the test us are site for afewdays observe the testubes after afewdays no rust is formed on the nails kept in the test tube air and be while rust can be seen on the nail kept in test up sea let us find the reasons behiron these different observations rust is not formed on the iron nail kept in the test tube air because the boiled water does not contain oxygen and the oil prevented the entry of more oxygen in to the test no rust is seen on the surface of iron nail kept in the dry air in the test tube be because the anhydrascaltion chloride at absorbed the moisture from the damp air present in the test up and made it dry of free from water rust is formed on the iron nail kept in the test tube sea because it is exposed to both air and water from this experiment we can conclude that the presence of air and water is are mostd for rusting of iron now let us summarise what we have learnt about corrosion,"['aluminium copper silver', 'air aluminium', 'air present', 'tube air', 'aluminium metal', 'dull air', 'copper metal', 'iron nails rubber', 'silver metal', 'water present', 'oxygen water', 'oxygen present', 'air', 'metal metals', 'green colour', 'chloride oil', 'ar chemical substance', 'aluminium', 'dark side', 'iron', 'copper', 'metal', 'water', 'silver', 'present', 'testubeb add', 'necessary conditions', 'direct contact', 'corrosion rate', 'common form', 'slow oxidation', 'several years', 'platinum articls', 'wide deposit', 'ar phenomenon', 'chloride', 'oxygen', 'green', 'colour', 'brown', 'tube', 'side', 'oil', 'metals', 'observations', 'nature', 'blast', 'nails', 'dull', 'add']"

Internal structure of skin, why do we put are cover and temple glass on or mobile forms exactly we do so just to prevent are pons from damage if they skip out from our hands and fall down by chance are from external factors like rain dust at cetera similarly are body also has many delicate organs how does our body protect them from external in vanment yes you are thinking in the right direction or body has are specialised ogen that acts as are coat and protects other organs from external in van men it covers the entire body and that why it is the largest organ of human body can you guess which organ are we talking about absolutely ride it is the skin it accounts for about fifteenposent of and adult human body way skin has two main layers epidermis and dermas ape means on top so epidermis is the outer layer made up of epithelial tissues and dermis is the inner layer made up of connective tissues first of all let us know about the outer layer epidermis is composed of ten stratified comes epithelium it is further divided into three sub layers the cornified layer at the top the granular layer in the middle and the germinative layer at the bottom let us quickly know about on special cacteristic of each layer the cornified layer also known as stratomconium is composed of det cells hence it lacks blood vessels the granular layer has granules in the cytoplasm and the germinative layer also known as malpighian layer is composed of living cells let us know about germinative layer in mode tail the germinative layer has are single layer of cells resting on basement membrane which lies between the dermis and epidermis since these cells are the wing the divide continuously and as new cells form the older cells are pushed towards the granular layer germinative layer contains pigment cells called melanocytes melanocytes produces melanin pigment that the sides whether we have we are complection or dark it also protects the deeper layers of the skin from the harmful effects of the ovules further ma skin is sensitive to touch do you know which cells are responsible for the sensation it is due to the presence of motosells in the germinate layer the contact sensory neurons by the flat and posion known as mol cal days just now we have seen that the other cells in germinative layer are pushed towards the granular layer now let us

Structure of Human Eye, eyes are or windows to the world eyes help us to perceived and respond to our surroundings humus possess of pair of eyes located in the deep protective bony cavities called vi codes or eye sockets of the cell eye is as spherical and hollow organ having the diameter of approximately two point five centimetres human eyes have the mosed complex internal structure the wall of an eye ball is divided into three concentric cos out of fibrous coat middle vascular coat and inner nervous coat these layers along with the lens the aquashumor and the without humor combine to form the contents of the ball the outer fibres coat is strict and tough that white the eye ball and maintains in shape it is composed of clearer and cornea the white the eye is the clearer which is opaque bluish whitish sheet of five rope lasted tissue and composed of collagen fibres cornea forms the anterior part of the fibres coat and is composed of connective tissue the transparent and dome shaped bent surface of the cone refracts sixty to seventy per cent ve light the outermost thin transparent layer of the eye is conjuctive conjuctive layer is formed of modified epidermis that lines the inner surfaces of the eyelids and continues to cover the visibocerface of the clearer except for the central clear portion of the cornea the conjuctive forms the first layer of protection against the infections the middle vascular coat is further divided into corrode ciliary body and iris the corrode occupies the most of the area of the vascular coat and is connected to the clearer it is highly vascular eyes and composed of ar soft connective tissue that contains abundant pigment cells these pigment cells darkened the eye ball cavity to prevent internal reflection of light that might blue the image on the anterior side the corroid is thickened to form ciliary body the ciliary muscles and ciliary processes collectively form the ciliary body the ciliary muscles and ciliary processes pole lens of the eye in plays their relaxation in change the shell of the lens the iris is thin and collar portion formed by the sharp bending of the vascular coat and the junction of the clearer and the cornea the eye colour is dependent on the pigment present in the iris in the middle iris is perforated by an aperture called pupil with the help of the two sets of the smooth muscles that is dilates and spintells the size of the pupil can be varied and the iris regulates the amount of light and ring the eye born retina is the innermost and incomplete layer of eye it is multi led sensory tissue which is composed of the innermost ganglion cells the middle bipolar cells and the outer pigment it cells of the for to receptor cells the outer pigmentedlair is in contact with the corrode the outer pigmented retina is composed of different types of photo receptor cells that have light sensitive pigments our eyes used to different types of photo receptors to see things in day and night these on batchapes the two tides of photo receptors are road cells and cone cells the rod cells cont in ap purple pigment called visual purple called rodubsen the function in dimlight and night and produce poorly defined images in human eye the number of road cells is much higher than that of the cone cells the cone cells provides visibility during the day light the artificial right light with the help of the pigment called aludopsen called visual violet asmall oval and yellowish area of the retina lying exactly opposite to the centre of the cornea is called macula lutea called yellow spot as it has yellow pigment in the middle of the macularlutea as shallow depression demarcate the region called fovia the fovia has cone cells only and is the place of the most distinct vision the ganglion cells form the innermost layer of the retina the exons of the ganglion cells formed the optic nerves these optic nerves leave the eye ball from a point called line spoon the retina where the for to receptor cells are absent thus which is insensitive to light the lens of the human eye is he solid elastic body that lies behind the iris and consists of he transparent fibristition which is enclosed in athin transparent and elastic membrane called lens capsid the lens is by convects however it is more convex and the posture aside than in the front this property of the lens helps in focussing the light on the retina the lens is held by the suspensary ligaments the lens divides the cavity of the eye ball into two chambers malle acquischamber and large vice chamber the acquischamber is filled with the transparent watery fluid called aquishumor which is continuously secreted by the ciliary processes the shape of the eye ball is maintained by the acquishumr by maintaining the intra ocular pressure that is eye pressure it also nourishes the lens and the cornea the white chamber encloses the space behind the lens that is filled with the thick transparent jelly like substance called the victoshumor which is secreted by the retina only during the development of the eye it helps in maintaining the shape of the eye ball thus the human eye act as conscious sense organ that reacts to

into larger neuro fibres the dendrites are short tapering cytoplasmic processes or filaments that extreme from the some dendrites typically branch profusely get intine with each branching and extending their farthest branches of few hundred micrometers away from the some th get narrower as the extend farther away from the sol are some gives rise to multiple branching often resulting in ar

the cell body at acid called the axon hillon and travels for adistance as far as one meter in new mons or even more in other species the axon varies in length it can be just of few millimetres long such as the inter neurons in the brain or over three feet long as ar motor neuron from the spinal called to the turns its specialised plasma membrane around the axon is called exolema typical exons almost never contained ribosomes endoplasmic reticulum hence metal granules are absent in this region nerve exons in some cells can be surrounded by amileand sheet which contains of white fatty

Bohrs Atomic Model, to decode the structure of atom was the bigger challenge for the scientists before max well gave electromagnetic theory rather folds model was the most accepted model to describe structure of atom but rather fold model fail to explain the stability of the atom as pointed out an electromagnetic theory of max well according to max well electromagnetic theory if at charged particle moves around another that particle it accelerates and continuously loses energy in the form of the radiant energy loss of energy would slow down the speed of the electron and the angle the electron would fall into the new class however such acolatsded notice and rather folds model was unable to explain the recent behind another scientist neelsbole was confident about the existence of new pleas in site atom as proved by rather folds famous alpha particle catering experiment but he was not sure about the position of electrons around the new clears the performed an experiment to identify the position of electrons around the new clears in that experiment after setting the apparatus he with ton gaseous hydrogen lamp and allowed its rays to fall on aprism as the result hydrogen molecules present in the lamp dissociated to form hydrogen atoms and they produced electromagnetic radiations of discrete frequent says do you know why it happened it happen due to jumping and falling of electrons of various hydrogen atoms in to different energy levels by either gain or loss of energy on the basis of his experiment meals bold in nineteenthirten gave model for hydrogen atom in order to explain the line spectrum and the stability of the atom let us discuss posed postulates one by one as our earth revolves around the sun in the solar system similarly in an atm electrons revolve around the nucleus in fixed circular path of fixed radius and fixed energy without losing any energy these fix circular paths are known as or beta stationary states or allowed energy states or principal contemnumbers it is denoted by nm and its value may be from one to infinity these can also be denoted by ml m em etcetera let us assume data particle of mass em moves with will of type in as circular path of radius are it angular momentum can be represented by em we are angular momentum of an electron in an orbit is the integral multiple of at upon to by here and denotes the number of the orbit for various orbits tally of en varies here you can see the angular momentum for various orbits we can say that angular momentum of an electron in an atom is contis transition of the electron states place in two ways excitation of electron bear an electron revolving in lower stationary state gums to higher stationary state by absorbing definite amount of energy the excitation of electron we are an electron revolving in higher stationary state releases definite amount of energy and falls to lower stationary state in both cases energy is absorbed or relies in the form of photons only if an electron changes that position from one stationary orbito another the difference in energy can be calculated as shown here let us discuss merits of posetomic model it explains the stability of an atom according to this model if an atom is not disturbed it electrons will go on revolving in their specific orbits for ever and the atom will remain stable it helps to calculate the energy of the electron in aorticular orbit the energy of an electron moving in apoticular orbit or hydrogen atom can be cal coated by the expression shown here bowl model also helps in determining the radius of aperticler orbit it is used to calculate the velocity of an electron it explains the atomic spectrum of species containing one electron only for example hydrogen atom according to bows model when an electron the excites from a higher energy level to a lower energy level it emits energy this emitted energy is quantised and corresponds to a fixed frequency or wave land this forms the basis of the existence of a large number of well defined lines in the atomic spectrum of hydrogen bows model also explains the simultaneous appearance of a large number of lines in the spectrum of hydrogen these lines are limen bamer fashion bracket and fund each transition of an electron from a higher energy level to a lower energy level gives rise to a discrete spectral line in the emission spectrum of the atom it helps to calculate wave function with the help of rid birds formula what are demerits of bows atomic model it was unable to explain the spectrum of the multi electron atoms it could not explain bond formation between the atoms for example in expand and so the emploride covalent bond including molecule it could not explain relative intensities of the spectral lines it could not explain fine spectrum of atoms it was unable to explain the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of magnetic field that is semen effect or the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of electric field that is starch effect in nineteen twenty four louisdivroguely proposed that an electron exhibit dual behaviour that is wave as well as partical nature just like radiations but according to bows atomic model an electron is the discrete particle bows atomic model was not in accordance with hysonburgs on certain ti principle according to this principle the position and momentum of an

Polarity, al can halides are derivatives of hydrocarbons formed by replacing haregenatum by halogenatum the molecubes of alkalhellide are polar in nature the attracting power of halogenatums and carbonatums are different which gives rise to the polarity the turn polarity can be explained by the simple example aboard filled with some cube suffice and another bold is filled with some sugar cues are placed on the table after some time the sugar cubes are surrounded by ants while the ice cubes are left alone this is because the sweetness in the sugar cubes attracts the ants towards it in the same way halogenatums are more electronegative than carbon so the electrons are more attracted towards the haloga rather than the carbon thus giving the carbonatum ar partial positive charge and the halogenatum are partial negative charge,"['partial negative charge', 'partial positive charge', 'sugar cubes', 'cube suffice', 'simple example', 'turn polarity', 'way', 'cubes', 'sugar', 'polarity']"
Preparation of CO2, preparation of carbon dioxide in the laboratory carbon dioxide is usually prepared by the action of dilute hydrochloric acid on marble ships marble ships are taken in around bottom flask dilute hytrocloric acid is added to marble ships through the thistle funnel as a result brisk effervescence of carbon dioxide is produced since the reaction is exothermic in nature so produced carbon dioxide may have some hydrogen chloride way pars that is why to produced gas is allowed to pass through the sodium by carbonate where hydrogen chloride gas gets absorbed in order to remove the moisture the gas is further mate to pass through concentrated sulphuric acid finally dry carbon dioxide gas is collectid in the jar by the downward displacement of the mercury let me tell you dilute sulphuric acid is not preferred over dilute hydrochloric acid actually it forms th white and soluble air of calcium sulphate around the marble ships and this coating does not allow the marble ships to come in contact with the acid,"['marble ships marble ships', 'dilute sulphuric acid', 'carbon dioxide gas', 'chloride gas', 'carbon dioxide', 'sulphuric acid', 'flask dilute', 'further mate', 'thistle funnel', 'marble ships', 'chloride', 'brisk', 'acid', 'dilute', 'gas']"

Overview of Mass-flow-hypothesis, in plants the site of energy capture and production of food are its green parts you must have read that the leaves are the site of for the synthesis thus the leaves are the site of production of sugars and are called the source carbon die oxside and water combine to form sugar source is often far from the side where energy is most needed which happens to be the growing parts sacs the root tips parts petiole at seta these sides of utilisation of sugars are called the sing special transport systems become necessary to move substances across long distances to in short transportation at the faster rates water minerals and food generally moved by mass or boric flow system in the mass floor all substances whether in solution or in suspension are swept at the same pace the bulk movement of substances through conducting or vascular tissues of plants is called translocation source is an organ that produces more sugars and bases required and sink is an organ that consumes sugars for its growth and storage the accepted mechanism needed for the translocation of sugars from source to sink is called the pressure flow by proteases let us have are close look at how the food is translocated in the plant body there are two kinds of vascular tissues in the plants the sylum the transports water and solved minerals and loan which transports car high rates mainly sucrose all the glucose is the product of photosynthesis it is not suitable for transport because it is chemically active reducing sugar while on the other hand sucrose is and long reducing and soluble sugar flowing sap comprises of water sugars amino acids organic ascent some cations and anions flowing cells are connected end tso ends by way of sea plates these perforated structures create direct connection between the side plants of connected flow themselves the newly site sides sucrose sugar is then moved into companion cells and into the living flowing see cues by active transport active transport requires the expenditure of energy it helps to remember that the flowing is located just tation to the silum which helps in water transport from the roots to other parts of the plant this proximity as the significant consequence the actively supported in plants of sugar into the flowing results in passive movement of water from the clum where the sugar consecration is low into the flowing where the sugar concentration is high this passive movement of water forms of concentration gradient which dilates the solution by way of process called osmosis the diffusion of water into the flowing creates an region of high osmotic pressure in the region around the sugar source as osmotic pressure in the flowing seated increases the fluid is true away from the sugar source the sap moves through the flower think of plant parts where energy expenditure is required the identified areas around the growing root and so tips but petiole require energy the most and are called the sink at the sink incoming sugars are actively ransported out of the phloem and removed as complex carbohydrates in the sing as the sugar concentration in the flown drops so does the water in plants from the xylem low levels of water in the xylem creates areas of low pressure in the flowem near the sugar sing with high pressure areas near the sugar sols and low pressure areas near the sugar sing fluids in the flowem are driven to flow down the pressure gradient from source to sink in this way sugars made in the leaves are transported from the leaves to roots where grove is taking place in some plant cells are special protein called the transport brotine located on the membrane of the vacuole called tonoplast facilitates the movement of sucrose from sink cell site possum into the vacuole at the expense of eight be this reduces the concentration of sucrose in the sink cells which enhances the movement of sucrose from flown cells through companion cells and into ink cells all these events produce acontinuous flow of water from xylem to phloem and back to xylem it helps to remember that the water leaving floem moves up the xylem due to transpiration and not due to water potential difference between xylem and cloum,"['water transport', 'water sugars', 'sing special transport', 'pressure flow', 'rates water', 'sugar source', 'high pressure', 'sugar sing', 'water potential', 'low pressure', 'plant cells', 'sink cells', 'plant parts', 'water', 'other parts', 'high rates', 'sugar', 'pressure', 'cells', 'transport', 'sugars', 'other hand', 'significant consequence', 'see cues', 'side plants', 'direct connection', 'perforated structures', 'sea plates', 'end tso', 'organic ascent', 'sap comprises', 'close look', 'vascular tissues', 'same pace', 'mass floor', 'short transportation', 'parts', 'flow', 'high', 'site', 'source', 'plant', 'low', 'movement', 'long', 'energy', 'special', 'sing', 'sink', 'sap']"

representing the solutions of equations has non in tequalquodin aids let us consider an example to explusv equal ten and three ex minus for vi equal aid to draw the graph of these equations we need two pairs of solutions for them as zero ten five zero and zero negative to net for negative five after plotting the points on the graft and joining them we get two stratevines which are in the secting at point at we know that this point is the solution of given pair of linear equations in two variables can you determine the coding of point by looking at the graft orbit difficul there is every possibility of making mistakes will determining such quodinades is there any alternative method of finding the solution yes there are some algiquaq methods which we shall now discuss first method is substitution method substitution method for solving ar pair of linear equations is or method in which value of von variable in terms of the other from one equation is substituted in the other equation consider appear of linear equations in two variables two ex plus vi equal ten and three ex minus for vi equals aid here we have two equations we can choose either of the equations and video one variable in terms of the ether let us consider equation one two ex plus vi equals ten we can write it as why equals ten minus to its it means that the variable vi can be substituted with ten minus two ex in equation to so if we substitute vi with ten minus two in equation two in becomes three ex minus four times ten minus two ex equal aid now this is an equation with one variable we need to solve it four eggs on solving it further we get eleven times ex equals forty it which implies ex equals forty eight by eleven now we could go back and substitute the value of ex in two either of these equations to solve for vi let us substitute the value of ex in equation two ex plus vi equal ten on substituting the value of ex in equation we get vi equals fourteen by eleven so the solution to the system of equations is ex equals forty eight by eleven and vi equals fourteen by eleven we can also verify the resolved by putting both the values in two either of the equations let us take equation three times ex minus four times why equals aid on putting the value of ex and why we get left ane side equals white hand side we can solve pair of linear equations by using elimination method also as the name suggests one variable is eliminated to solve the pair of equations let us understand it with the help of an example two times ex plus vi equals we three times ex minus two times why equals for multiply equation one by two so we get four times ex plus two times why equal ten consider this as equation three now consider equations two and three we can notice that coefficients of vi are opposite in sine think what will happen if we add these two equations let us sec at term vi would cancel out and we would get seven times ex equals fourteen so ex equal to now we can go back and substitute the value of ex in two either of the equations to get the value of we on substituting the value of ex in equation one we get two times two plus vi equals five we get why equals one in this way we get the value of ex and why which satisfy bold dequations cross multiplication method less is another method by which we can solve or pair of linear equations let us understand it with the help of an example two times ex plus six times equals minus said four times ex la seven times why equals minus fourteen step one transpose all the terms to the left hand side now we have two equations as two times ex plus six times why plus eight equal so four times ex plus seven times why plus fourteen equals zero step to ry down all the quoefficiens and constant terms separate laid here one is coefficient of as we one is quoefficient of why and see one is constant term in equation ne similarly eight two is coefficient of ex we two is coefficient of hi and see two is constant term in equation to step three use the formula ex upon be one stu minus be two cone equals vi upon two cone minus on stu equals one upon on be two minus two be one step for substitute the values of coefficients and constant terms in the formula on simplification we get ex upon twenty eight equals why upon four equals one upon negative ten step five we can frame two equations from this equation in terms of ex and why as ex upon twenty eight equals negative one upon ten and why upon four equals negative one upon ten on simplification we get exequals negative two point eight and why equals

Characteristics of Fish, characteristics of fish fish have been in existence for more than four hundred million years during which they have evolved repeatedly to fit into almost every type of aquatic habitats certain kinds of fish travelled together in groups the precision with which the group of fish twist and dives in union is one of the nature as wonder more than twenty thousand living kinds of fish are known which vary in their shapes and sizes fish are fascinating aquatic animals some live along sea floor while the rest roam in the open sea a fish is the cold blooded animal that has a backbone and breeds by means of kills the gill openings are covered with a smooth flap called operculum fish swims by sideways muscular movements of extreme lined body the fins are used for balancing and rooting fins are composed of a web of skin supported by horny rays there are two paired fins pictorial fins and pelvic fins and many unpaired fins like dorsal cordal or tail in of fin nearly all the fish are protectively coloured to resemble the surroundings and deceive enamens or prey fish are found in nearly all aquatic invimens from the sunny surface of the ocean to the darkest depth when light never penetrates,"['aquatic habitats certain kinds', 'fish fish', 'unpaired fins', 'fish', 'aquatic', 'horny rays', 'muscular movements', 'smooth flap', 'gill openings', 'rest roam', 'wonder more', 'fins', 'blooded', 'sea', 'kinds', 'dorsal', 'more']"
Consistency of Lenz s Law with the Law of Conservation of Energy, we know that ar changing magnetic flat lend with the coil induces and eamepanet this induced ea met into in generates an induced current in the coil the direction of induced current in the coil is given ba the lenses law according to this law the direction of current in the coal is that thagneteposes the change in magnetic flat linked with the coil and work has to be done and moving the magnet towards or away from the coil the glowing but connected to the coil shows that the work done in moving the magnet is being converted into electrical energy in order to check if the lenses laws consistent with the law of conservation of energy consider the situation contradictory to the lenses long let us assume that the direction of induced current is tha that the south pole of the magnetic field due to this coil is near the north pole of the approaching magnet in this case there will be of poles of attraction between these two poles of opposite polarigy and the magnet will automatically get old towards the coil therefore no work has to be done in moving magnet towards the coil in this way we will get electrical energy without doing any word when north pole of the magnet is pulled back the near end of the coil at as not pole and hence repels the magnet due to this repulsion the magnet moves away from the coil automatically again no work is done in moving the magnet away from the coil similarly when south pole of magnet approaches the coil let the direction of induced current in the coil is that that near end of the coil acts as the north pole again the magnet will get attract towards the coil due to opposite polarity and therefore will automatically move towards the co when the south pole is old back the near end of the coil acts as the south pole this leads to the repulsion between the coil and magnet and the magnet moves away from the coil in all these cases we can see that no work is done in moving the magnet to words or away from the coil however during the relative motion of the magnet and coil we get the electrical energy shown by the glowing bond thus we get electrical energy without doing any work this violates the law of conservation of energy and therefore our assumption is wrong thus we can say that the lenses law is in accordance to the law of conservation of energy,"['lenses laws consistent', 'near end', 'situation contradictory', 'electrical energy', 'lenses law', 'induced current', 'coil induces', 'opposite', 'pole', 'magnetic', 'near', 'lenses', 'energy', 'current', 'law', 'coil', 'induced']"
Converse of Pythagoras Theorem, how about exploring further the patagrastirum which you have already learnt the turum stated that the square of one side at to the square of the other side is equal to the square of the hypotenus you probably on the patagrastirum retina in gvordform most like la it as formula as square plasbsquared equals csquared the stands for the hypotenus of the triangle which is the longest side of the triangle and the and stand for the are the two sides of the triangle you know that this herumhals true of the time to day we on tuesqlore whether the convos of the tirum hole true suppose the three sides of triangle are such that the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides does this mean that we no for shorten that the is ar right angle triangle do you think so this it possible that it might not be true this kequestion is actually something that mathematicians have wondered and have successfully proven the converse of the patagrastirum is always true this means can us the converse term to help prove at triangle in be at right triangle suppose we have atriangl with the longest side as five centimetres and other two sides as for sent meters and three centimetres five squared equals tuentifile on calculating the sum of the squares of the other two sides we have thresquared ple for square equals ninequlacxten which is equal to twenty file so sum of squares of length of two sides is equal to the square of the length of the longest side therefore the triangle with sides five centimetres far centimetres and three centimetres is a right angle triangle with the angle opposite to the side five centimetres as the right angle now we prove it in the form of term the turum stated as in atriangle if the square of the length of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides then the angle opposite to the first side is ar right angle lets now prove red we are given atrangl bc at that ac squared equals by squared plus bc squared we have to prove that triangle bc is right angled at ba we will do some constructions to prove thes draw trangld right angled at such that de equals ab and equals bc can you apply patagrastirum in triangle de of course you can since it is aright angle triangle so in triangle de by patagrastirum we have the square equals sum of the squares of the sides d and but we have d equals ab and equals bc by construction this gives us de squared equals by squared plus bc squared since we are given that ab squared plus bc squared equals squared so de vsquared equals ac squared thus de equals ac now in triangle bc and all the three pairs of corresponding sides are equal therefor triangle bc scongruen to triangle de by as as as congruent true and hence angled equal ang ebycbct be tangled equals ninety degrees by construction so angle be also equals ninety degrees so triangle bc is right angled at be hence proved can you determine whether atringle with sides five centimetres seven centimetres an an centimetres is at right angle triangle or not nine squared equals tan five squared pleas seven square equals twenty fit plus forty nine which is equal to seventy for we are the square of the length of the longest side is not equal to the sum of squares of lengths of the other sides so the triangle with sides five centimetres seven centimetres and nine centimetres is not at right angle triangle let try our hands at some problems now problem one says that triangle bc is an isosceles triangle in which ab equals ac and bad spopendicula to ac prove that cd multiplingby ab equals bb squared mine cd squared hold upon to for examination purpose can rate given and to pro statements the for start the solution now since it is given that bb spopendicu that due ce so triangle bb is aright angle triangle right angled at de this gives be square equals dsquared plus bb squared bypahtgras tirum this equation can be rr tan as shown since we are given that ab equals can you write ac ingems of ad and cd yes ac cequal to the sum of ad and cd now you know that equasbequal squared equal squared plus be squared plus to be on applying this formula and simplifying further we arrive at our result let try another problem and and ten feet away from the foot of of wooden pole which is five fetal crows towards at after moving through at distance its distance from the top of the pole cequal to the distance it has moved how far is the and away from the foot of the pole lets try to solved lets draw a diagram to represent the given information first let ab represent the pole with high five feet let the distance between the an and the foot of the pole is be which is ten fed after moving at distance let the and be at seed joins and dt at now let us assume that as equal fed equals ex fed therefore bc equal ten minus ex fed can you see ar right angle in this diagram in triangle abc angle be equals ninety degrees therefore ac squared equal ab squared pleas be squared by patagras term on substituting the given values and simplifying further we find that ex equals six point to five feed therefore bc equals three point seven five feet so the and is three point seven five feet away from the foot of the pole we will now solve one more problem problem three says that in apadrilatral pecures angle cu equals ninety degrees if we squared equal spice squared plus car squared plus are squared then prove that angle pars is ar right angle we are given that angle cu equals ninety degrees therefore in triangle pick ar by patagrastirum we have be cu squared plaster squared equals par squared but it is given that psquared equal specusquaed plaster squared plus are squared lets name this equation as one replacing pecusquared plaster squared by par squared in equation one we get psquared equal sp ar squared plus are squared thus in triangle pars we have pesquaed equals par squared plus are squared therefore

Graphical Method of Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations, we have learnt how to frame equations if we are given with some conditions let us learn how to find the solution of apair of linear equations in two variables graphically at first plet us see how linear equation in two variables can be represented on or graph throvebrout three for balls and two pair of clove for rupees three hundred suppose the piles of one for bold is ropes ex and the price of one pair of glass is ropes why so the given situation can be frame in the form of linear equation as three ex plus two vi equals three hundred let us try to solve this problen let us leaner equation in two variables because the exponents of the verables involved are one now how can this equation be represented on or graph to represent this equation we need to find pair of values of ex and vi that satisfy the equation in order to point values for ex and vi if we take why as zero we get ex as hundred and if we take ex as zero we get we as one fifty have you observed vi did we take value zero for ex and why this is only because of making of calculation and plotting of points easier however we can take any random value for ex and get value for vi so here we have the values of ex and vi using these two pairs of values we can plot these points on the cartesian can on joining these points we get as threat line it us as simple graph but there are many things we can in for formed think all the points that lie on this line will be the solutions of this linear equation take any random point fifty seventy five let us put ex as fifty and vi as seventy five three ex plus two vi equals to three hundred three multiplied by fifty plus to multiplied by seventy five equals three hundred one fifty plus one fifty equals three hundred therefore left hand side equals right hand side thus we can say that the point fifty seventy five lies on the line of the given equation now how desthegrafph of two lean equations look like using two points zero one fifty and one hundred zero we have already drawn ar graph of the equation three ex plus two vi equals three hundred take one more equation say ex minus two vi equals zero let us make at table for the second equation and for second equation we get twenty coma ten and one fifty coma seventy five plotting these points on the graph and after joining them we get two straight lines all the points that lie on the first line will satisfy the falstequaion and all the points that lie on the second line will satisfy the second equation that is ex minus two vi equals zero is there anything which you can notice from this graph think look at the point where bother lines intersect the point lies on bold the lines so this is the point with satisfies both equtions seventy five thirty seven point five is the solution to ba the lines since seventy five thirty seven point five is the only common point on bother lines it implies this set of linear equations will have only one solution which is why this is pot consistent pair of linear equations what do you think any pair of linear equtions will have always one solution can they have no solution or infinite solutions consider an example three ex plus vi equals eleven six plus two vi equals twenty to draw these equations one graph we need some points to plot let us draw two tables and find quaneights take random values of ex and get corresponding values of vi consider equation one three explaiequals eleven on taking ex as zero we get vi equal eleven similarly fr ex equals won we get hi equals eight in this way we get two points zero eleven and one eight tonsider equation two let ex as zero we get hi equal ten let ex as one we get why equal seven in this way we get two points for equation two zero ten and one seven using these points we can plot the points on the graph and after joining them we get lints corresponding to the equations what do you observe if you are point to say that these lines are pale teach other yes you are right they are pale trace other what will it imply there is no common point that satisfies these two linear equations there is another case where we observe a pair of lane equations have no solution which is why it is called inconsistent pair of linear equations cannot pair of linear equations have infinitely many solutions lets explored consider another pair of linear equations as two explaspi equals sixteen it explaspourvi equals sixteen to plot these equations graphically take random values of ex and get corresponding values of five for equation one if we take ex as zero we get vi equals sixteen if we take via zero we get ex equals seven point five so we get at table which shows values of ex and vi similarly for equation two it explaporvi equals sixteen if we take ex equals zero we get vi equals sixteen if we take vi equals zero we get ex equals seven point five we have two tables for two linear equations plotting these points on the cartesian plane we get agraph oh what do you observe interestingly they are running over each other in this case these pair of leaner equations will have many solutions which is why they are called as consistent pair of

Graphical Representation of Solution of a pair of Linear Equations, graphical representation of solution of ap pair of linear equations consider the pairs of linear equations in two variables let us all then one by one by using graphical method let us start with first pair of linear equations and represented graphically for this first we will find at least two solutions of each equation in the first equation to explain wind as for is equal to zero if we consider excess equal to zero then we get we equal to four and if we consider is equal to zero then we get axes equal to two in the second equation ex last vi mine as three is equal to zero if we consider excess equal to zero then we get wise equal to three and if we consider vi equal zero then we get excess equal to three graphically we observe that the given lines intersect each other at only one point which is one to so there is a unique solution for the given pair of lane equations now the the second pair of linear equations in the first equation two ex plus three vi bind as six is equal to zero if we consider ex equal to to then we get wise equal to to and if we consider wise equal to zero then we get ex equal to three in the second equation for ex lasexwi wind as twelis equal to zero if we consider ex equal to zero then we get is equal to to and if we consider vi equal zero then we get excess equal to three graphically we observe that this pair of linear equations going sides and therefore ever point on the line is common solution to both the equations so the equations have infinitely many solutions now take the third pair of leader equations in the first equation four ex plus to vi bind as for is equal to zero if we consider excess equal to zero then we get is equal to two and if we consider is equal to zero then we get axes equal to one in the second equation to plus vi minus for is equal to zero if we consider axes equal to zero then we get we equal to four and if we consider is equal to zero then we get exisequal to two graphically we observe that the lines are final to each other this means that he if wations have no common solutions let us compare the ratios of corresponding coefitions in these pair of linear equations in the first pair of linear equations we observe that if lines are intersecting an there is the unique solution then the ratio one upon he to is not equal to be one upon be two in the second pair of lane equations we observe that if lines are coincident and there are infinitely many solutions then the ratio one upon at we ne upon be to see one upon zitwo are equal to each other in the first pair of linear equations we observe that if lines are pale and the rest no solution then the ratios one upon at two is equal to be one upon we two but not equal the on upon set in fact the converse as also true for any pair of leader equations in two veriros represented by the equation we one ex plus we one by plus see one is equal to zero and he to plus we to why lose to is equal to zero,"['ex equal', 'second equation ex', 'ex lasexwi', 'second pair', 'first pair', 'equal', 'common solutions', 'common solution', 'second equation', 'first equation', 'graphical method', 'graphical representation', 'corresponding coefitions', 'equations', 'ex', 'pair', 'equation', 'solutions', 'solution', 'first']"
Addition and Subtraction of Integers, will works has another water photographer she starts at opposition that as twelve feet below sea level she rises seven feet and then the sends nine feet to take up perfect picture of star fish can you tell lily's elevation relative to sea level when the to the picture well se level is the level of the see that is the zero line anything above it is positive and anything below it is negative since lily started at twelve feet below sea level so or position is represented by the integer negative tell now she rise the seven feet so we add number seven to negative tells again she descent nine feet that is she goes down nine fee so we subtract nine can you solve this expression it gives the final elevation of lily can you tell her final elevation clearly to solve this expression unit to know how to add or subtract two integers do you remember the rules to add or subtract integers let we call them on by one we will first add integers with the same signs here are two expressions you can easily solve the first one because you know that two plus for is sex now coming to the second expression here both the numbers are negative integers how will you add them first you have to add the numbers ignoring the signs that is to plus for is six and then keep the common sign of both the intgers that is the negative sign so negative two plus negative for is negative sex in general to add integers with the same signs add the numbers ignoring the are signs and use the common sign of the integers for the sum of tan now this edition can be visualised on the number line as well to add two and four start from two and move four units right words we reach at six which is the answer to add negative to an negative for start from negative to and move four units left words we reach at negative six which is the answer remember that to adapositive integer we move to the right on an number line and to add ar negative integer we move to the left on an number line now what happens when the two integers that are to be added hav different signs let say you have to add negative to and positive for what will you do when you have an edition problem in which addence are of different signs then yu must subtract the smaller number from the bigger number now bad while deciding which number is bigger you have to ignore the signs of the numbers so subtract two from four but the answer will take the sign of the bigger number since for is the bigger number so negative two plus for is two on the number line start from negative to and since you have to add apositive integer so move for units right words we reach at two which is the answer now what is the answer if you have to add positive two to negative for you must subtract two from four to get two and since four is the bigger number so the under is negative two on number line start from to and move four units left words to reach at negative to this is all about addition of integers now here is up quit question for yo as shown in the illustration time add an negative balance in his strain pass before doing are chart of fifty ropes what is the new balance of time strain pass the balance in time train pass is negative fifty now the we add fifty rupees to his card so we add fifty to negative fifty can you solve it since the integers are with different signs so subtract fifty from fifty that gives zero so the balance in times card is zero rope what do you observe here when negative fifty is additive fifty we get the answer as zero the integers negative fifty and fifty are called additive inverse of each other figuring out the additive inverse is ease pick ar number the additive inverse of that number is the one that makes zero when added to at we sually this means thadd they are equidistant from zero on the number line now we will use additive inverse of an number to find the die ference between two numbers you already know that six minors for is to now if you have to subtract negative for from six what will you do lets wisalize this on number line fors start from sex will you move to the left all right sin you have to subtract an negative number so you must be temp tide to move life words if you move four units left words then you get two but it is not the correct answer since six minors four is to hence six mines negative for cannot be to so you move right words from six if you move for units right words then you reach at ten which is the answer consider it in another way we know that additive in vs of negative for is four thus it appears that adding the additive inverse of negative four to six is same as subtracting negative for from six we write it as follows hence to subtract an integer from another integer it is enough to add the additive inverse of the integer that is being subtracted to the other integer this rule can be applied to any subtraction problem are shown here to remember this rule we have to formal for any two integers and minors b is equal to plus negative b and minors negative be is equal to plus be now here is aqua question for you neety evaluated the expression shown here and came up with the answer negative nine what might net have done wrong neety change the operation to edition but forgot to add the additive inverse of negative for the expression must be re ration as negative five plus for which is equal to negative one it is time to solve or problem now jacobstracts his high at an elevation below sea level when he reaches the end of the high he is still below sea level at negative fifty eight feed what is the changing elevation from the beginning of jacuves high to the end of the high we will solve this problem step fives we will write an exprestion to represent change in elevation change in elevation can be calculated by subtracting initiove elevation from the final elevation that is negative fifty eight feet mines negative one twenty seven fee in step to find thetivefrons as learned just now to sbstract negative one twenty seven from negative fifty eight add its edative inverse that is one twenty seven to negative fifty eight now use the rule for adding integers with diverent signs the answer is sixty nine so the elevation is increased by sixty nine feed how can you say that the elevation is increase it is because the answer is positive can you now answer the question asked in the first place lily elevation can be calculated by first adding seven to negative tell which gives negative five then subtract nine from negative five to subtract nine add its adative in vs that is negative nine to negative five the answer is negative fourteen so lily final elevation is fourteen feet below sea level note that the negative sign in answer represents the elevation below sea level in an nasal to add integers with the same signs add the numbers ignoring their signs and use the common sign of the integers for the sum obtain to add integers with tin signs subtract the smaller number from the neger number and use the sign of the bigger number for the sum obtain to subtract an integer from another integer it is enough to add the additive inverse of the integer that is being subtracted to the other integer,"['negative number', 'ar negative integer', 'integer negative', 'answer negative', 'mines negative', 'negative balance', 'negative sign',

Distributive Property, we are already aware of we is properties of whole numbers like closure property commutative property associative property an existence of identity there is another property called distributive property in a general sense when you distribute something we divided into parts lets consider as inario gon mother gave fi candies and six proberies to him she then give the same number of candies and strobberies to is two friends round and jar can you find the total number of items that gone and his friends have you can find the total number of items by finding the sum of the items that each one has and then multiple the result with three as all the three boys have an equal number of items there are two ways dissipify the given expression first by simplifying the brackets firs then multiplying the result with the number tray in this way we get the total number of items as thirty tray another way is to multiply three with each of the numbers in the brakes and then simplified them separately as shown here in this way to we get the same value so we can say that three multiplied by five plus six is equal to three multiplied by five plus three multiplied by sets you can observe that here the number three is being distributed over the values inside the brackets in other words it is the distributibuty of multiplication over addition this property of the whole numbers is known as distributive property but way don you think that in our initiosinario the calculation done without using distributive property was abit easier than the one using distributive property when we applied distributive property we have to multiply prices and then be added the numbers so what is the us of distributive property lets discuss using an example find the product of ninety five and one hundred one if you multiply ninetifve with one hunbreth one by usual multiplication method it will take abit of time but by using distributive property it can be done quickly to do this ry one hundred one as one hundred plus one now by using the distributive property of whole numbers you can easily multiply ninetifive with one hundred one on for the simplification we get the final answer as nine thousand fi hundred ninety five here is one more example find the product of twelve and thirtifive using distributive property here we write thirtifie as the sum of thrty and five then using distributive property over addition we get twelve multiplied by thirtyplas five equaltotwelve multiplied by thirty plus twelve multiplied by five which is equal to four hundred twenty have you noticed that to solve such multiplication problems we write one number from the given numbers as the sum of two numbers using the nearest multiple of ten practice some more problems so that utcan have an idea of which number distribuexpress as the sum of two numbers using the nearest multiple of ten do you know that distributive property holds good for multiplication over subtraction two lets have a look at they example of the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction suppose we have to multiply six with thirteen minus five this can be performed in two ways first sol with by simple find the races so we get six multiplied by thirteen minus five is equal to six multiplied by at which is equultive forptyay now by using distributive property we get six multiplied by thirteen minus five is equal to six multiplied by thirteen minus six multiplied by five is equal to seventy eight minus thirty which again is equal to forptyay observe that the final result is same in both the casts thus we can say that we can distribute multiplication over subtraction two but it is not necessary that we get the final answer as the whole number in this case so this was all the but distributive property in an not shell multiplication is distributive over addition and subtraction for whole numbers,"['whole number', 'same number', 'multiplication problems', 'number', 'inario gon mother', 'property', 'multiplication', 'more problems', 'final result', 'final answer', 'equultive forptyay', 'nearest multiple', 'abit easier', 'way don', 'other words', 'brackets firs', 'fi candies', 'general sense', 'more example', 'same', 'whole', 'forptyay', 'fi', 'abit', 'brackets', 'way', 'multiple', 'candies', 'result', 'example']"
Division of Integers, you are already familiar with the rules to multiply two integers so division is and inverse process of multiplication but the rules to divi two integers is same as that of multiplication of integers to verify this lets look at some integer patents with division can you find the missing cohions you can observe that as the dividendecreases by three the cushion decreases by one so negative three divided by three must be zero min as one which is equal to negative one and negative six divided by three must be negative one min as one which is equal to negative to this completes the pattern can you draw some conclusions from this pattern you may notice the following when ar positive integer is divided by ar positive integer the cushioned is folsitive when zero is divided by ar positive integer the cushion is zero when a negative intrger is divided by ar positive intrgere the coin is negative now lets look at another pattern to discover more rules can you find the missing cosions you can observe that as the dividenincreases by two and the divisor decreases by one each time you get ar cushion of negative two each tin with the exception of zero divided by zero which is an defined following the pattern the missing cosions must be negative to this completes the pattern can you draw some conclusions from this pattern you may notice the following when zero is divided by zero the cushioned is undefined when ar positive integer is divided by a negative integer the cushioned is negative now here is one more pattern for you can you find the missing cohions you can observe that as the dividend decreases by three the cushioned increases by one so negative three divided by negative three must be zero plus one which is equal to one and negative six divided by negative three must be one plus one which is equal to to this completes the pattern what conclusions can be draw from this pattern you may notice the following when zero is divided by a negative integer the cushioned is zero when a negative integer is divided by a negative intager the cosine is positive so we can say that when we divide two integers we first divide them as whole numbers and if the signs of both the given integers are same then the cushioned is positive and if the signs of both the given integers are different then we put amine assign before the obtained cushion now its time to solve a problem afootpoltine lost ar total or forty five yards on nine can negative lays the team lost the same number of yards on each play represent the number of yards lost on each play as anegative intrgere first represent the total number of yards lost as an integer since the integer shows are loss of fortifieyards youse a negative integer that is negative forty five to represent the laws for each of the nine plays divide the integer representing the total number of yards lost by nine to find this cushion we need to divide two inates with ive in signs divide the integers without being attention to the signs give the cushion ar negative sign the intagen negative five represents the number of yards lost on each play in ar not shell the division of two integers which same signs gives ar positive answer the division of two integers we different signs gives an negative answer the division of zero by any integer is zero the division of any integer by zero is not defined,"['ar positive integer', 'negative integer', 'ar negative', 'ar positive intrgere', 'ar positive answer', 'negative answer', 'negative', 'ar total', 'more rules', 'same signs', 'same number', 'total number', 'problem afootpoltine', 'amine assign', 'whole numbers', 'inverse process', 'integer', 'positive', 'more', 'ar', 'signs', 'same', 'number', 'intrgere', 'rules']"
Introduction to Integers, you will find it interesting to know how much the temperature of or place can were across the world on any given day for example it could be twenty nine degree celsius above zero in may army and at the same time it could be three degree celsius below zero incanader it is good to know that we at different types of numbers available to represent these wearing temperatures across the world considering as in narrio the temperature of twenty nine degree celsius above zero is or positive number and we write it as twenty nine degree ive tears where as the temperature of three degree celsius below zero is are negative number and we writer as negative three degree ive tears but do you know how low do these negative numbers go well you might already know that they go as low as the positive numbers go high it means that bother positive numbers and the negative numbers are intine whether the numbers are positive and above zero or negative and below zero all whole numbers and the opposite are called integers this means that the numbers on the thermometer the ones we count with the flows of or building are all integers hope you got an idea of integers but what about zero is zero and integer well zero is an inter give two it may be near the bottom of the thermometer but its at the senter of the number line if you move right of the zero on number line you get one to three four five and so on that is positive numbers and if you move left of the zero you get negative one negative two negative three negative for negative five and so on that is negative numbers so positive numbers zero and negative numbers together negative set of integers and you choose in tatures from this lot of numbers clearly negative on five twenty nine negative seventeen are all integers and the rest of the numbers are not inters here is an important point to keep in mine there are move fractions of decimals in the collection of integers now here is aquatgrestion for you elite are stands at three on number line and moves five int left to reach have two can you tell the posation of elite school on the number line if you move five units left from three on the number line then you reach at negative to so eliture school is at negative to having learnt about intatures it is time to know how to compare two are more integers you probably know how to compare positive numbers very we like if you are asked which is greater four or five clearly five is greater than four but if you are asked which is greater negative four or negative five this is where negative numbers can be little thrice since five is greater than four so you must be tempted to think that negative five is greater than negative for but itis not two atrally negative five is smaller than negative for to understand this let look at the number line again if you start at zero on the number line and keep moving ride then the numbers get greater and greater one is greater than zero two is greater than one three is greater than two for is greater than three five is greater than for and so on but what happens iv we go in the opposite direction that is to the left as we move to the left the numbers get smaller and smaller four is smaller than five three is smaller than for two is smaller than three one is smaller than two and zero is smaller than one can we alive the same rule on the negative side of the number line yes the numbers get greater when you move to the right and the numbers give smaller when you move to the lear since negative five is on the left side of negative for so it is smaller than negative for and you can use this idea no matter what the numbers are for example four hundred is greater than three hundred since it is to the right of three hundred and negative for hundred is smaller than negative three hundred since it is to the left of negative three hundred so the positive integers are on the right side of the zero on number line which means they are greater than zero and the negative integers are on the left side of the zero on number line which means they are smaller than zero so when you compare two positive inates farther the number on the right of the number line greater than number as for example ten is greater than five and ninety is greater than eight when you compare are positive integer with ar negative integer remember that are positive integer is always greater than ar negative integer for example fifteen is greater than negative five and forty is greater than negative forty now when you compare to negative inates farther the number on the left of the number line smaller than number as for example negative five ten is smaller than negative five and negative thirty is smaller than negative twenty let try out ar problem now arrange the numbers negative three five negative ten zero and seven in ascending order ascending order means from the smallest to the greatest the smallest number here is negative ten so it comes first the number greater than negative ten in the given numbers is negative three so it is the second number in order then comes zero five and seven you can verify your answer by marking these numbers on an number line they must lie in the same older from left to right on the number line as founder bar in ar nasal intages can be positive negative or even zero as you move to the right on the number line the intages get greater and as you move to the left they get smaller comparing integers become easier with more practas so keep practicing,"['negative number', 'positive negative', 'numbers

Multiplication by Zero and Multiplicative Identity, zero is aspecial number which shows that the is no amount you already know that multiplication of or whole number with zero give zero it means multiplication of any pultitive integer with zero give zero can you tile what happens when you multiply an negative integer with zero do you remember the patan that we analysed for multiplication of two integers here we observe that the multiplies decrease by one and the products increase by four let take one of them the patan here shows that when you multiply an negative integer with zero the also of tan zero so negative for multiplied by zero equal zero also zero multiplied by negative for equal zero by comtitive property of multiplication of integers whether you take zero as the first integer of second integer when you multiply any integer with zero you get zero as zeanswer in general for any integer multiplied by zero equals zero multiplied by a which is equal to zero and we call it the multiplication property of zero can you find the production here do you see multiplication by zero in it so the answer of the whole product is zero and hence there is no need to do the other multiplications but do nt get carried away this onlyequors for products for example what is negative three multiplied by zero min as negative to multiplied by for the first part is negative three multiplied by zero which equals zero but we still have to do the second part which is negative to multiplied by for and it is equal to negative so the whole answer is zero minus negative which is equal to next let take to integers and be such that they are product is equal to zero can you say something about ea or be we can say that if aprodulct ab is equal to zero then at least one of the integers itherthe mol the be must be equal to zero since we know that product of any integer with zero is zero so if ea is zequalto negative five then ewould have to be equal to zero or if we may be equalto negative then would have to be zero of course it is also possible that both ea and we are equal to zero now you have learnt the multiplication by zero can you think of any other number that has special multiplication property like zero what about one lets explore what happens when you multiply an integer with one you already know that multiplication of or whole number with one gives the same number it means multiplication of any pultitive integer with one gives the same integer what happens when you multiply an negative integer with one if we see our patan again then we observe that multiplication of negative for with one gives negative for also one multiplied by negative for equals negative for by comitative property of multiplication of integers on observing some more products of integers with one we see that each time you multiply an integer with one you get the same integer bar this shows that one is the multiplicative identity for intgrs why do we call it multiplicative identity because on multiplying with one the entity ive much in its identity that is stays the same in general for any integer we have multiplied by one equals one multiplied by a which is equal to we now can you recall word the additive inverse of in integer is the additive inverse of an integer is its oppose for example the additive inverse of five is negative five and the additive in volts of negative for is for but whats the point we are studding multiplication ride well can you think of an integer with when multiplied by five gives negative five on multiplying five with one you gave five but you need negative five yes you are thinking in the right direction on multiplying five with negative one you get negative five also negative one multiplied by five is equal to negative ive by comitative property of multiplication thus the product of an integer and negative one is the additive inverse of the integer in general we say that for any integer ea multiplied by negative one equals negative one multiplied by a which is equal to negative way in anushe product of anintagur with z yo gives zero product of an integer with one gives the integer itself and product of an integer with negative one gives the additive inverse of that integer,"['negative integer', 'same integer', 'first integer', 'multiplication property', 'whole number', 'other number', 'negative', 'same number', 'whole product', 'integer', 'z yo', 'right direction', 'additive inverse', 'multiplicative identity', 'more products', 'aprodulct ab', 'number', 'first part', 'property', 'multiplication', 'whole', 'product', 'other', 'additive', 'identity', 'products', 'part', 'same']"
Multiplication of Negative Integers, you have learnt some of the rules of multiplication of two integers you have to first ignore the sines of the integers and multiplied them as whole numbers then you have to chece we that ive sines of both the integers are same potivefron if they are different then you know that the answer is always negative if they are same and they are two positis then the answer is positive now observe this flow chart can you tell what happens ive both the sines are same and negative for example what is the product of negative for and negative three to find this that multiply negative for wettive fin integers and then and lies the pattern for by now you must no that the product of negative for and three is negative to ev product of negative for and two is negative what is the product of negative for and one yes it is negative for and of course the product of negative for and zero is zero because anything multiplied with zero become zero now here comes the key question what is the product of negative for and negative one if you observe the pattern formed above then you will find that as the multiplier of negative for decreases by one the product increases by four so the product of negative for and negative ne should be zero plus four that is four in the same way negative for multiplied by negative two is equal to negative for multiplied by negative three is equal to toes and so on here are some of the rules that you can conclude from this pattern when negative for ar negative integer is multiplied by are positive integer the product is negative when negative for ar negative integer is multiplied by zero the product is zero when negative for ar negative integer is multiplied by ar negative integer the product is positive thus we can say that t the product of two negative integers is ar positive integer therefore to multiply two negative integers multiplied them as whole numbers and the result is always positive thus we have negative fi multiplied by negative is equal to pot similarly negative ive ten multiplied by negative ten is equal to one hundred and five ta in general for any two integers and be the product of negative ea and negative be is equal to the product of and be thus while multiplying two integers if the sines of both the integers are same whether they are two positives or two negatives the product is always positive now here is aqua question for yo ray evaluative negative five multiplied by be for py is equal to negative seven and gave an answer of negative third five is ray correct ray has to evaluate negative five multiplied by negative seven clearly they are some must be are positive integer the cause negative plyingsnegatee is always positive so negative five multiplied by negative seven is equal toepive multiplied by seven which is equal to thirty five hence ray is inter now here are some other ways in which multiplying integers my taper some times the multiplication simple is replaced with ado note that at pot between two numbers also means multiplication also as set of parentices necesto another set means multiplication it was all about multiplication of two integers but what about multiplying three or more intages together the rules for multiplying two integers can be extende to ar product of three al more integers can out the product of three integers shown here we know that the product of negative for and negative three is twelve so the product of negative for negative three and negative two is to multiplied by negative to that is equal to negative twenty four what about the product of for negative integers shown here from ar previous calculations we can observe that the required product is equal to negative to intive for multiplied by negative one which is equal to twenty four again what about the product of five negative integers shown here it is negative five multiplied by twenty four that is equal to negative one hundred twenty do you see ar patent here the product of two negative integers is a positive integer the product of three negative integers is a negative integer the product of four negative integers is a positive integer and the product of five negative integers is a negative integer can you tell what will be the product of six negative integers yes it will be a positive integer it means that if the number of negative integers in a product is even then the product is a positive integer and if the number of negative integers in aproduct is odd then the product is a negative integer this rule can be applied on any integer and hence the product of negative one with itself can be cat elataeas shown here this means that if the integer negative one is multiplied even number of times the product is positive one and if the integer negative one is multiplied odd number of times the productive negative one lets work out some problems now what is the square of negative five it is equal to negative five multiplied by negative five which is equal to twenty five note that the answer is positive because we multiplied to negative integers what is the cube of negative then it is equal to negative ten multiplied by negative ten multiplied by negative ten which is equal to negative one thousand note that the answer is negative because we multiplied three negative integers here is another problem for you mole multiplied six positive integers and seven negative integers together can you tell the sign of the product evaluate by mole since there are odd number of negative integers that is seven negative integers in the product so the sign of the product will be negagair now its time to do some brain storming determine the sign of the product of nine hundred seventy two positive integers and one thousand fifty three negative integers further describe a real ol situation that can be represented by the product of negative for and negative third then find the product and explain word the product means in terms of the real world situation,"['negative integers', 'ar negative', 'negative', 'more integers', 'fin integers', 'ar previous calculations', 'integers', 'ar product', 'odd number', 'cat

Multiplication of a Positive Integer and a Negative Integer, as we are gets ready one morning she realise this that she has gain some ex proved so she decides to go for jogging every morning from to modo next day we are dresses up in had jogging clots and leaves her home for coding she know that tan calries are burnt for every minute she jogs if we are jogs for twenty minutes at day can you rid an integer to represent how many calories will she burn in ar day if the burning of calories is represented by ar negative integer the number of calories burn in ar mine is negative ten so the number of calories band in twenty minutes will be simply twenty multiplied by negative ten this is ar problem of multiplication of integers which you will learn to sol to day nits go through the basics of multiplication first we call that multiplication is repeated additional for example three multiplied by two means to at three groups of to it can be written as shown here and we say that three times to is sex can you use repeated addition to find three multiplied by negative to twe multiplied by negative two means to at three groups of negative to it can be written are shown here and we say that three pines negative to is negative sa fate you have to find twelve multiplied by negative for twelve multiplied by negative for means to at twelve groups of negative for such are calculation on number line will become besum so let us now learn howto make this calculation easy you are already well versed with the multiplication of two positive integers four multiplied by three is equal to tell four multiplied by two is equal to way four multiplied by one is equal to for do you notis that the products show or patan as the multiply or of four decreses by on the product decreases by for that is each product shown is four less than the previve product suppose you do not know the product of four and zero how can you use the patan shown here totiternintive product you can subtract four from the previous product for to find the missing product sense four by as four is equal to zero the are for the product of four and zero must be so so far we have only looked at the positive products but now since the are learning he but negative integers we can caltinue the patan to know how to multiply are positive integer and negative integer what should be four multiplied by negative ne you can subtract four from the previous product to find the next product remember subtracting four is the same thing as adding ive or posed that is negative for so to find the product of four an negative one at negative four to zero which is equal to negative for so four multiplied by negative one is negative for in the same way four multiplied by negative to is negative day four multiplied by negative three is negative to and so on here are ar few rules that we can conclude from the patan when for are positive integer is multiplied by are positive inter the product ive positive when for are positive integer is multiplied by zero the product is zero when for are positive integer is multiplied by ar negative integer the product is negative now can you find negative for multiplied by three to find this observe the following patan as the multiple can decreases by on the product degrees ive by three so negative van multiplied by three must be zegomynes thread that is zero plus negative three which is equal to negative three in the same way negative two multiplied by three is negative sex negative three multiplied by three is negative nine negative for multiplied by three is negative twelve and so on so whether you rid for multiplied by negative three or negative for multiplied by three the answer ive same that is negative twelve thus we observe that by multiplying are positive integer and ar negative integer we multiplied them as whole numbers and put are mind as sin before the product we thus get a negative integer always remember that when you multiply two integers with die and sines then you get ar negative integer as the product so to find the product of twelve an negative for first find twelve multiplied by for which is equal to forty at and then put mind as sin be for for tie to get be mula as negative for the at in general for any two integers and be we can say product of a and negative is equal to the product of negative and b which is equal to product of a and b preceded by ar minor sign here is the original problem once again to find the answer unique to multiply twenty with negative ten multiply twenty with ten which is equal to two hundred and put ar minor sign before two hundred so me are burns two hundred calories in ar day note that the minor sign indicates the burning of calories now here is a quick question for complete the number grid by following the direction of arrows ten multiplied by two is twenty eight twenty multiplied by negative three is negative sixth and then negative sixty multiplied by five is negative three hundred lets work out one more question to reinforce the multiplication rule we have learned if astarb means a multiplied by b minors b then find negative three star two negative three star two will be negative three multiplied by two minor two negative three multiplied by two is negative six and by suppracting two from it we get the answer as negative eight in or nutshell multiplication of two positive integers gives ar positive integer multiplication of ar positive integer and ar negative integer gives a negative integer multiplication of a negative integer and ar positive integer gives a negative integer,"['ar negative integer', 'negative integer multiplication', 'negative day', 'same way negative', 'negative integer', 'ar positive integer multiplication', 'negative sa',

Properties of Addition and Subtraction of Integers, jimmy and gene are enjoying how shape on a cool day with the temperature of negative five degree cell cars the temperature dropertintigre se sees by night can you tell the temperture at night the temperature at night is negative five minus then degree celsius that hence negative five plus negative tentegree celsius which is equal to negative iv ten degree cell sees negative five when added to negative ten gives negative fiftine all of these are int gas do we always get in integer when we add or subtract integers lets find out jimmy and gene are various balls with integers printed on them both of them put one ball eat at he time in the addition machine and get the output as the sum of integers every time they put balls in the machintiget in integer out put valle in other words there is no pair of integers who sum is not an integer this means that when you at two integers you always get an integer this illustrates the closure property of addition in general if and b are any two integers then aplasb is also an integer hence we say that the integers are closed under adtion thus this closure property hold true or the subtraction of integers as well lets check this out with the subtraction machine both gemmy anginy put a ball each in the subtraction machine and the result they of tan is clearly an integer lets check it for another pair of integers jimmy puts ea ball with integer eight in printed on it in the subtraction machine jimmy puts the ball with integer negative five printed on ner eighteen minus negative five is printed tray which is an integer as well this means that when use subtract to integers you always get an integer this illustrates the closure property of subtraction in general if and b are any two integers then aminosb is also an integer hence we say that the integers are closed on the subtraction so the closure property says that if the operations of addition and subtraction are applied on any two integers then the sum of the fans obtained is also an integer we have some more properties of it tation and sbtraction of integers lets explore about them jimmy puts the ball with integer negative five printed on it in the addition machine and then jimmy puts the ball with integer ten printed one the sum obtained is five what happens if giny puts the ball with integer ten first and then gimy puts the ball with integer negative five then also the sum obtain is five eventually we figuredout that it does not matter in with order you put the balls in the machine you enter with the same result since the two intages on either side of the tation simple can such positions without changing the answer we say that the commute since commute means to travel back and for mathematical operations in which the numbers operated one can die twist without affecting the result are said to be committee this illustrates the comitative property of addition in general if and b are any two integers then aplasb is equal to be place and we say that the addition of integers is committee does this comitative property hold true in case of subtraction of integers as well let see by using the subtraction machine gimy puts the ball with integer three printed on it in the subtraction machine and then gmy puts the ball with integer negative one printed on ner three minus negative one is for hower word if we with the order of put in the balls then negative bone minus three is negative for we see that changing the order changes the answer in general if and are any two integers then aminorsb is not equal to be min ace hence we say that the subtraction of integers is not committeter in simple words for any two integers and b aplasb is always equal to we plus but minors be is never equal to be minor say now lets try to extent this property of changing the order to the addition of three integers line comes along and wants to play with gimy in gene now gjimmy puts the ball with integers sevenprinted on it in the edition machine ginmy puts the ball with integer negative three printed on it and then line puts the ball with integer negative at printed one can you add the three integers we add them in groups and see iv the order is important first lets add negative three and negative it is negative eleven adding seven to it gives negative for next lets first at seven and negative three it is for adding negative at to it gives negative for in these two cases the numbers were grouped interfere ways before they were added however we ended up with the same rise this in less traits what is called the associative property of addition because it does not matter in which way the numbers are grouped or associated with tiger the in the end the all add up to the same number in general if b and c are any three integers then we can write this property as plus whole plus is equal to plus be plus hole hence we say that addition of integers is associate does this associative property hold true for subtraction of integers as well lets find out by using the subtraction machine jimmy puts the ball with integer fold printed on it in the subtraction machine ginmy puts the ball with integer negative six printed on it and then line puts the ball with integer to printed on at we subtract them in groups and see if the order is important first lets subtract negative six from for it is ten subtracting two from ten gives at next lets first subtract two from negative sags it is negative at sbtracting negative at from for give tell we observe that on changing the groups of numbers in the same expression the result changes in general if and c are any three integers then minors bold minors is not equal to mines be minors hole hence we say that the sbtraction of integers is not associative last but not the least we will talk about the additive identity property an additive identity is the number that when added to other numbers gives the same number can you think of such an number for the set of integers when you add zero to any integer or any integer to zero it equals the integer it sail so zero is called the additive identity for integers for example negative for plastero is equal to negative for and zero plus negative for also equals negative for in general if is an integer then aplazero is equal to zero plus which is equal to in an ace integers are closed under addition and subtraction addition of integers is comitateve but subtraction of integers is not committee addition of integers is associative but subtraction of integers is not associative zero is always the additive identity for the set of integers,"['associative property hold', 'negative tentegree', 'addition machine', 'identity property', 'associative property', 'property hold', 'negative', 'integers

Properties of Division of Integers, jar and wise are solving problems on integers when fizamulteplies two integers she gets an integer but while solving aproblem on division of integers she got start she observes that the division of two integers does not give an integer result she is thinking about were is she wrong as per her division of two integers must give an integer is wise right no she is wrong the vision of two integers may or may not give an integer result for example if you divide fifty by negative five you get negative tan which is an integer but if you divide negative five hundred by negative two hundred the cushion cannot be represented by an integer this is the cause the cussion is of fraction and the collection of integers does not include fractions in general if and b are any two integers then adivided by b need not be an integer hence we say that be integers are not closed on the division this is the first property of division of integers now ga is solving sixty divided by negative for and wise is solving negative fold divided by sixty they are confused because they do not get the same answers which they thought so you can check this for any are the pair of integers as well negative foptynine divided by negative seven is equal to seven but negative seven divided by negative forty nine is equal to one upon seven in general if and b are any two nonzero integers then divided by b is not equal to be divided by hence we say that the division of integers is not come tiger this is the second property of division of integers now can you tell what will be the cushion if you divide any nonzero integer by itself any nonzero integer divided by itself will give one as the cushion moreover any integer divided by one gives the integer itself as the cushion both these properties together are called the property of division by one and hence form third property the next thing to wonder about is what will be the cushion to when any nonzero integer is divided by negative one any nonzero integer divided by negative one does not give the integer itself as the cushion also any nonzero integer divided bi ites opposite gives negative one as the cushion both these properties together are called the property of division by negative one and hence form fourth property now jar and wise have solved all division problems involving two integers in the next exercise they have to solve problems involving division of three or more integers both of them have to solve the problem negative hurt two divided by at divided by negative to jar grouped negative tertytwo an eight together however wise grouped at an negative to together do they get the same answer lets get gasolves the bracket first so negative thertytwo divided by eight is equal to negative for then negative fold divided by negative to is equal tide let see the answer obtained by fizar this are divided eight by negative two first which gives the answer as negative for then she divided negative thirty two by negative for and the answer obtained as at the answer is different from that of gas both of them are this appointed again can you tell why this happened this happened because in the division of integers the result changes when the grouping is gains in general if b and se are any three nonzero integers then adivided by b whole divided by se is not equal to divided by b divided by se hole hence we say that the division of integers is not associate this is the fifth property of division of integers both you understood all the properties its time to solve ar problem now there revived the following relations consider the first relation on solving the left hand side of the relation we get negative for and on solving the right hand side of the relation we get negative eighteen clearly both sides of the relation do not give the same result hence verified in the same way you can verify the second relation what conclusion can we draw from this problem we can say that distributivty of division over addition and subtraction is not true for integers in au natural integers are not closed under division division of integers is neither commutative nor associative division of any integer by one gives the same integer but it is not true in the case of division by negative one division does not distribute over addition and subtraction for integers,"['problem negative', 'same integer', 'negative', 'second property', 'first property', 'right hand side', 'left hand side', 'same result', 'division division', 'natural integers', 'nonzero integers', 'property', 'nonzero integer', 'same', 'integer result', 'associative division', 'next exercise', 'division problems', 'next thing', 'se hole', 'equal tide', 'second relation', 'first relation', 'integers', 'division', 'integer', 'problem', 'se', 'equal', 'first', 'relation', 'result', 'problems', 'right']"
Properties of Multiplication of Integers, you already know that some of two integers is an integer and difference of two ntages is an inter as well precisely we say that integers are closed under addition and subtraction our in tags closed under multiplication do we always get in integer on multiplying to or more integers let the here are are multiplication problems on writing the product we observe that each product is an integer can you think of apare of integers whose product is not an integer well you cannot because no such pericas in other words to integers multiply together will always result in an integer in general if and be are any two integers then multiplied by is also an integer hence we say that the integers are closed under multiplication the next property you are going to learn about is commutative property it states that when two intges are being multiply they are order can be changed without affecting the product for example five multiplied by negative for as the same product as negative for multiplied by five you can check this for any pair of integers in general if and be are any two integers then multiplied by be is equal to be multiplied by and we say that the multiplication of integers is commutative but what if you are dealing with more than to intages for example if you are multiplying three ntages or frintages tulste mode in which you multiply matter then well that precisely where the associative property comes into the picture the associative property of multiplication says that the we in which you group three integers while multiplying them does not affect the produ for example we can solve the problem five multiplied by negative to multiplied by negative for either by multiplying the first to numbers and then multiplying this product to the last number or by first multiplying the last to numbers and then multiplying this product to the first number to show the difference in both the cases we use parentheses the first way is to write five multiplied by negative to part in parentheses to show that it happens for and the second way is to write negative to multiplied by negative for part in parentheses to show the opposite ordering of course no matter which way you solve this problem the ulcer is always forty in general if be and se are any three integers then we can red this property as multiplied be be whole multiplied by se is equal to multiplied by be multiplied by se hole hence we say that multiplication of integers is associate now do you know how to use these properties to speed up calculation you can use these properties to help you multiply numbers faster the idea is that instead of multiplying an list of numbers in the order they are written from left to right you can multiplied them in any order von for example in ar problem like shown here you would be wise to use commutative property and first multiply and negative fit to get negative forty the reason this is wise is that it gives you multiples of ten then multiply negative fopty and negative to to get at and finally multiply eight antert to get two thousand for hundred why is that a good idea because its al lot less work than going from left to right like thes negative to multiplied by at is negative sixteen then negative sixteen multiplied by tt is negative for hundred at then we get negative for hand with eight multiplied it negative five can you find this product so easily you multneed to think about that og its to thousand for hundred so prefer doing the problem the first way and work with multiples of ten as much as possible to make multiplication easier in anatshell intgurs or closed under multiplication multiplication of integers is commutative and multiplication of integers is associative as we iv,"['multiply negative', 'multiplication multiplication', 'first way', 'first number', 'first multiply', 'lot less', 'negative', 'integers multiply', 'ar problem', 'order von', 'se hole', 'opposite ordering', 'same product', 'other words', 'such pericas', 'property', 'first', 'tulste', 'multiplication', 'integers', 'way', 'number', 'multiply', 'idea', 'se', 'problem', 'order', 'product']"

Acquired and Inherited Traits, we know that human beings possess body features like hair eyes knows years et cetera that is the basic body design is the same yet we can distinguish one individual from the other moreover we can even spot the differences between parents and their progeny and between the semblings as well do you know how it is possible yes you got it ride it is by the virtue of radiations that exists between the individuals so the question that arises ears are these variations inheritable that is to all these variations transfer from one generation to the next well the answer is no only the changes that occur in the gemsells or gametes of fectually reproducing populations are inherited by the progeny whereas the changes that occur in other bodies sells during the lifetime of an individual organism are not passed on to the next generation let us understand these concepts with the help of an example of rabbit population in architec region the appearance of the white for collar variant in the rabbit population of dark for rabbits wire reproduction is an example of inherited trait as the offspring of this white werient will also be wide when these white variants walk around on the snow they will remain unnotes by the foxes but the brown coloured rabbits will be visible on knows and will be spotted and at on by the foxes here the white collar for the the survival advantage to the rabbits and so they became common and it can be said that the white colours naturally selected thus the in easily rare white wearient became ac common character in the population due to reproduction as the teany of the gametes or germ cells was change this change which passes on to the future generation becomes the pieces of the evolution and these tradesare known as the inherited trades however so ten traits are not passed on to the next generation these trades are called acquired trades let us understand acquired trades with the help of as scenario if ar group of miss is bred it is expected that their progeny will have tails however these the days of bees mice are removed by surgery in each generation will these tiles mice have taless progeny when bread well no all the offspring formed will have atale this happens because the removal of the tail does not bring about he change in the de one of germ cells of the mice whose tale was removed thus the trait was not transferred to the progeny now let us leak at examples of acquired trades present in human beings that are not passed on to their progeny some of them are the muscles that wire through physical training exercises and diet loss of body part like limbs due to injury that dose lackination etcetera likewise the experiences and learning of an individual acquired during the lifetime such as swimming reading cycling et cetera are usually the result of neural muscular interactions they do not change the dent of germ cells do you know what it implies well it implies that the knowledge or experiences that we gain by years of practice do not result in the changes in dent and so these traits cannot be inherited so they do not result in evolution you will be surprised to know that although the idea of evolution of species by natural selection was given by charles darvin in the nineteenth century it did not know the mechanism by which the variation was present in the species so now from these examples of acquired and inherited trades it is clear that the ideas of genetics and heriety our essential for understanding the peaces of evolution of species here the changes that occur in the germselves or gametes of the sexual he reproducing population pass on to the future generations and become the basis of evolution these trades are known as inherited trades whereas the traits acquired by an individual organism results in the changes in non reproductive cells these traits are not fast on to the next generations and are known as the acquired trades,"['white collar', 'white', 'reproductive cells', 'body', 'coloured rabbits', 'rabbits wire', 'reproducing population', 'natural selection', 'swimming reading', 'lifetime such', 'lackination etcetera', 'diet loss', 'trades present', 'ar group', 'future generation', 'common character', 'survival advantage', 'architec region', 'rabbit population', 'next generation', 'other bodies', 'reproducing populations', 'variations inheritable', 'hair eyes', 'human beings', 'muscular', 'training', 'mice', 'organism', 'et', 'cells', 'wire', 'rabbits', 'collar', 'future', 'present', 'trades', 'population', 'common', 'lifetime', 'next', 'generation', 'variations', 'other']"

Atmospheric Refraction, in a clear night sky we can observe that at one moment the stars appear to be very bright and the next moment they become very dim this happens again and again and we say stars twinkle at night but what makes stars to twinkle stars twinkle due to atmospheric refraction of their own light also we can see the rising sun about two minutes before it actually rises and we can steresee the sun for about two minutes even after it has set below the horizon this also happens due to atmospheric refraction of light lets first know about the atmospheric refraction of light are is present everywhere in the atmosphere the cooler air in the upper layer of atmosphere behaves as an optically denser medium while the hotter air in the lower lear of atmosphere behaves as an optically rarer medium hence the same atmosphere has different lars with different optical densities when light rays pass through the atmosphere having lairs of air with different optical densities then refraction of light takes plays this is cold atmospheric refraction stars emit their own light due to with the shine in the night sty when we look at the stars the intensity of light appears to be changing continuously due to which they become bright and dim and we say stars are twinkling when the light coming from astar enter is the old atmosphere it on to goes refraction due to danging optical densities of air at different latitudes as the atmosphere continuously changes so it refracts the light coming from the star by different amounts when the atmosphere refracts more star light towrds us the star appears bright here and when the atmosphere refracts less star light towards us the star appears to be dim so due to atmospheric refraction the light from the star reaching our eyes increases and decreases continuously an stars appear to twinkle at night have you ever thought whilanits tin of twin like stars lets understand this stars appear to us as appointsource of light the continuously changing atmosphere is able to cause radiations in the light coming from appointsizes star because of which the star appears to be twinkling but if we talk about the planet they are much closer to us due to which they appear as extended sources if aplanet is considered to be as the collection of alartionumber of point sizes sources of light the total variation in the amount of light entering our eye from all the individual point sized sources will average out to zero hence cancelling the twinkling effect lets now understand how atmospheric refraction is responsible for it and sunrise and delayed sunset the actual sunrise takes place when the sun is just above the horizon what due to the refraction of light from the sun we can see to rising before two minutes than its actual rising this was because when the sun is slightly below the horizon then its light from the rarer air to denser are is the refracted downwards as it passes in the atmosphere due to this the sun appears to be raised above the horizon when actually to slightly below the horizon it is due to atmospheric refraction that we still see the sun for about two minutes even low the sun has set below the horizon so the time for sunrise to sunset is lengthend by about two plus to equals to four minutes because of atmospheric refraction this might surprise to that if orthatno atmosphere the day would have been short about four minute,"['star light', 'point sized sources', 'atmospheric refraction stars', 'different optical', 'rarer air', 'atmospheric refraction', 'rarer medium', 'different', 'star', 'light', 'total variation', 'eyes increases', 'astar enter', 'lower lear', 'upper layer', 'next moment', 'atmosphere', 'night', 'air', 'point', 'sources', 'stars', 'medium', 'refraction', 'optical', 'actual', 'moment']"

Defects of Vision and their Corrections, this might are price that the first spectacles were made in italy in the year twelve ninety to day around half of the verspopulation is suffering from vision defects and or using ate contact lenses or spectacles having lenses of suitable force land ar normal eye can see the distant objects as well as the nearby objects clearly due to its power of or commoditio if we talk about the distant object then the rays of light coming from it are diverging in the beginning but after travelling as set and distance the becampalel when they reach the human eye after this or can convectilands of locanverging power and lac focal length can verge these pale rays on the retina then the image of the object is formed in case of nearby objects the rays of light coming from it are diverging when they reach our eye now when are contexts islands of high converging power and short focal land can verge thes diverging rays then the image of the object is formed on the retina this shows that to form the image of the distant and near by object or convex islands has the ability to it just its converging power biginging its force led but how does the focal lentofthe islands be chains the ciliary muscles can jants the thickness of the of and flexible islands and hence its focal length which in turn changes the converging power of the islands the ability of the ilenstoatjust its focal length is called the power of accommodation the ability of an it to focus the distant objects as well as the near by objects on the retina by just in the focal lend of its lens is called the power of accommodationsa normally human ni has the power of accommodation which enables objects as far as infinity and as close as twentifies intimate to be focus on the retina after this the ciliary muscles cannot it just the thickness of the islands toes it mean that the ice of see the objects no near point refers to the minimum distance the icanseeclearly without any strain where as far point is the maximum distance the icanseeclearly for a younger dull with normal vision the near point is twentifsinti mites and the far point is infinity beyond this the ciliarmuscles cannot it just the thickness of the islands is can see the objects bar to its strain and also the image on the retina is not clear this means the person is suffering from and defect mainly there ore common is defects mayopaipometro pea and press by or pea lets learn about each of the defects in detail yo pea also call that site less or near site less is an idefect in which or person can see the nearby objects clearly but cannot see the distant objects clearly the far point of and is becomes distant infinity and ar person can clearly see only of to ar distance of of fume tens this defect is caused due to hi converging power of islands or due to call being too long lets understand the results due to these to defects in some cases the ciliary muscles are that to the islands do not relax sufficiently to make the islands thinner and to reduce its converging power due to greater converging power of pislands the image of the distant object is formed in the form of the retina and hence the cannot see the distant object clearly in other cases the iball is too long due to which the retina is at at large distance from the islands even though the islands has the correct converging power but then also the image of the object is formed in front of the retina the far point of the mayopic is is at which is less than infinity the race coming from the far point if meet at the retina this means that if the distant object can be made to appear as if it was at the far point if then the eye can see it clearly but how can this be made possible this can be made possible is are concave lens of the suitable focal length is use the outer it faces thamayopic people to rear spectacles having concave lenses of paper force land but why is the concave lens advised this is because the light rays coming pale from the distant object are first diverged by the concave lens due to which it forms overtaimage at far point since the rays of light now appear to be coming from the far point so ilents easily focus them at the retin ar the main purpose of using ar concave lens is to decrease the canvrging power ofbthe islands and helps in forming the image of the object at the retina hypermetropia also called lonfitedness or for sitedcless is an defect in which or person can see the distant objects clearly but cannot see the nearby objects clearly the near point of hypermetropic eye is more than twenty five centimetre this aid effect is posdleuto low converging power of islands or due to iv being too short in some cases the ciliary mussels become prove that the can of make the islands theta to increase its converging power due to which the image of the object in case of ar hypermetropic eye is formed behind the retina and hence the eye cannot see the object clearly in other cases the iball is too short due to which the retina is at as manner distance from the islands tueto this case also the image of the of rectisfomd behind the retina the diverging race of the light coming from an nearby object placed at the normal near point ofjwentifies entimete from the ilents or converse to form the image of tie object behind the retina the image is formed behind the retina either due to low converging power of islands or due to the ibald being too short the near point of the hypormitropic eye becomes more than twenty five centimetre the diverging race of light coming from ar hypermetro picpersons near point can be ropes by his i on the retina this indicates that if the object place at the normal near point can be matto apia as if it were placed at the ice near point then the eye will be able to see it clearly but how can this be possible this can be made of cable is ar convex lens of the suitable focal lend is used the doctor advices ar persons of ring from hypermetropia to verspecteccals having ar concave lens of proper focal land but why is the convex lens use to cure this effect lets understand the diverging race of light coming from the nearby object placed at twenty fisentimete or ferst canvrged by this convect clends due to this the convex lens forms of virtual image of the nearby object at an near point of the hypermetropic eye since the race appear to be coming from the near point of the defective eye they can be easily focus by the islands to form the image of the object on the retina the purpose of using ar concave lens is to increase the converging power of the islands this now know about another aid effect called press bio pea which usually occurs in old age press bio pea is any defect in which ar person in old age cannot see the nearby objects clearly due to loss of power of accommodation of the eye an old persons of ring from pets bio pea cannot treat comfortably without spectacles the near point of such persons becomes more than twenty five centimetre press bio pea is similar to hypermetropia and can be cured by using aspectacle having aconvexlents of suitable focal lend it is possible that ar person can is of ring from bio pea as well as hypermetropia for this bi focal lenses are used to cure this defect the upper part is ar concave lens to care mayopia while the lower part is aconveclents to correct hypometropia ar normal i can see the distant objects as well as the nearby objects clearly due to its power of accommodation the ciliary mussels can change the thickness of the soft and flexible islands and hence its focal length which in ten change is the converging power ofb the islands mayopia also calcasitedness or near sitedness is an idefect in which aperson can see the nearby objects clearly but cannot see the distant objects clearly hypermetropia also called lonsitedness or for sitedness is an idefect in which are person can see the distant objects clearly but cannot see the nearby objects clearly press bio pea is similar to hypometropia and can be cured by using aspectacle having aconvexlents of suitable focal land,"['ar normal eye', 'doctor advices ar persons',

Evolution, the at inhabits more than to million varieties of organisms which are different in shape sizes and the way they live but you will be surprised to know that many dissimilar looking organisms have evolved from ar common in cesta for example many mammals have evolved from are common ancestor one fifteen million years ago gradually by the process of evolution so what is evolution well evolution is the development of an organism over many years from primitive form to or more advanced form the new species thus formed is distinlea different frombthe ancestral species now the question arises out does evolution ace evolution may occur de to many factors some of them are natural selection genetic drift mutation migration at seta let us understand bees factors more clear lie by taking of few scenarios in the first case we will see of situation in which green beetles dominated in the second case we see ar situation in which blue beetles dominated in the third case we will see as situation in which variation is reverted in the forest flora suppose there was the colony of twelve red beetles in the first situation some green coloured beetles were produced as the result of radiations cause due to sexual reproduction by reproduction the green beetles had trans mated the green colour to their progeny in this way few green beetles were also probes in the next generation after a few generations it was observed that the population of green beetles increase and that of red beetles degrees do you know the reason behind this well its because the red beetles were visible but green beetles were come or flare against the green coloured ba ground of the leaves so red coloured beetles were eaten up by the crows as he result of this after many generations the population been beaconsisted of green beetles hence in this case population of green beetles dominated now let us look at the second scenario in this case sexual reproduction produced to blue coloured radiant the blue beetles transmitted the blue colour to its progeny in this case botpured and blue coloured beetles were visible against the green background so both had an equal probability of being eaten up by the crows after an increase in the population of bother radians or big animal like an elephant stone on the bushes where beetles were pressn as a result most of the beetles died however by chance few blue beetles survive the blue beetles which are left exspanted their population after a few generations it was observed that the population mean leaconfrises to blue beetles hence in this case population of blue beetles dominated so what can be concluded from body examples well and bother scenarios are rare variation became the common characteristic however in the first scenario the variation became common because it gave survival advantage as the crows could not see the green beetles died their colour by looking at this ten area we can say that crows are the reason for natural selection you might think how well if the number of crows increases they will feed more on red beetles as he result the population of red beetles will decrease consequently the population of green beetles will increase hence the beetle population that is better adapted for the environment will eventually increase its number which obeys lay in this case is the green one thus we can say that natural selection is directing evolution on the other hand in the second scenario the colour change does not provide any survival advantage to the beetles as but the colour are equally visible to the crow its just that the blue colour of the beetles was elected accidentally if the be eel population would have been large the accident by the elephant would not have affected the population of the beetle thus we can say that the accidents caused in the small population can cause a change in the occurrence of genes even if they do not provide any survival advantage thus the second scenario is an example of genetic drift here evolution occurred in the population by chance and not by adaptation now let us understand the third scenario in aforest flora ar normal population of beetles existed after a few generations the plants showed the senterms of leaf diseases as the result beetles became smaller as they lost their weight because they could not get enough leaves to feed later on the disease was cured naturally and leaves became healthy so what do you think the next generation produced will also have low weight well the answer is no as beetles started getting desired nourishment the regain their weight and original size this shows that as long as plants were healthy the population of beetles expanded hence we ration was influenced by the environment here the low weigh trade was not inherited by the progeny some generations had low way due to scarcity of food but after the elimination of plant disease the new generation of beetles had normal weight hence in this case we ration is reverted so we can conclude that decrease in the wheat of beetles due to starvation is not an example of evolution this trait is an acquired trait which is not transmitted from parents to offspring even we can see some trades in our daily life like gain and loss of body weight which is not transferred to the next generation with these examples we understood that we reations produced during sexual reproduction give survival advantages over others however only the beneficial characters are transferred from one generation to another and finally lead to evolution the evolved species is not only the new species when the better working of the previous one with the survival advantage,"['few green beetles', 'few blue beetles', 'green beetles', 'selection genetic drift mutation',

Evolution and Classification, have we ever heard of or person getting their appendix operation to get removed or getting the vision truth removed from adentist do they have any rule in the functioning of the human body well these organs do not chave any rule in the human body these unneeded structures are known as vestigial organs and are remnants of the lost functions that were one posses by our ancestors they were once functional but over time the lost their utility and became known existen or so exist in diminished form scientists have identified this retrocrestion by studying human evolution and evolutionary relationships between humans and other organisms evolutionary relationships can be studied by file genetic treats the filegenitic tree explains the filegenitic relationships and is used for the classification of organisms now we may wonder what classification as and how it is dam classification means grouping atoms in such away that most closely related haractims for in the same growth and items that are widely tetron fall in other groups classification of organisms is done by studying the characteristics of organisms do you know what characteristics are cacteristics are the morphological or physiological properties of an organism which describe ar particular organism and its unicners for example the four lens of humans are their characteristic similarly plants for form pores entistis which is an inforgan characteristic of autotrophs in the first level of classification we will observe that certain disticharacteristics are common in most organisms if we move to the second level of classification we will observe that the characteristics are common in most but not in all organisms as the level of classification increases further the number of common characteristics decreases among the organisms now let us understand more about the basis of the classification of organisms organisms stand with defined on the basis of the presents are absence of nucleus in the same cells of the organisms in which the nucleus is present are nucleated and cells of the organisms in which the nucleus is absent are known as in nucleate organisms with nucleated cells are either unicellular are multicelitar multi cellular organisms can be further classified on the basis of the mode of nutrition adopted by them they can be either or tetra of are heterotrophs heterotrophs can neither possess askeleton on their innerside called the endoskeleton or they can possess as skeleton on their orgesside called the exoskeleto in this way the formation of arakhi helps in the classification of organisms into groves classification of organisms is atom to derive evolutionary relationships among organisms at agrans if organisms share more common characteristics it is possible that they are closely related and if organisms are more closely related we can say that the rate ride from or common ancestr let us understand with the help of an example observe the picture of or boy gon and his sister negative they are closely related gon is similar terhis first cousin dose however is most similar to ligate can you guess the reason for the same this is because gon and dice or are brother ancestor hence they are by logical parents are the common ancestors in the first generation before them however joseph is the first cousin of gon and is less closely related in comparison to are real sister neater hence their grandparents are common ancestors in the sic in generation before them therefore gon is most similar to ligate and less similar to go see so by studying the common characteristics we can study the evolutionary relation side now after understanding evolutionary relationships can you guess what changes mathavisulted in the evolution of human beings from apes to know the answer let us study how we have arrived at common ancestrs an number of common characteristics could be used to derive the evolutionary proximity of two organisms evolutionary proximity means closeness of organisms more or the number of common characteristics more recently they have evolved from common ancestors these on this fact we can trastart the evolutionary sequence of or particular organism classifying with the key shown leads us to small groups with all the similar characters and having very recent ancestires then there will be bigger groups of super groups which might have remote ancestrs in this way all the way back there will be a single organism so we have learnt that it is hard to believe that the sequence of the evolution goes back to unisimilar organisms and even to non living things however the study of evolution suggests that all the diversity we see today might just have evolved from the intraction of non living materials during ancient times,"['organisms evolutionary relationships', 'organisms organisms', 'organisms evolutionary', 'multi cellular organisms', 'groups classification', 'evolutionary relation',

Heart, are you familiar with this sound what is it this is the sound our heart makes as its heart is the organ that heat is going but what causes the heart to beat continuously heart is the complex pumping organ which beats continuously for the transport of blood and other substances throughout the body what do you think can any pumped work for years without stopping yes it seems impossible but our heart works like apomp non stop an efficient lay let us know about this energetic and amazing organ in detail the heart is hollow muscular organ located in the chest cavity in between the two lungs the lower tip of the heart is slightly tilted to words the left of the mid line of the body now make affect by holding your fingers inwards on your pump it represents the size of your heart yes the heart is about the size of affairs our body contains two types of blood one is which in oxygen and the other is which in carbon day what in both types mixed with each other in order to avoid this condition human heart is divided into four chambers the two upper chambers are called atria and the two lower chambers are called ventricles these chambers are separated by as septum in fact this septum helps to avoid the mixing of both types of blood this type of separation allows are highly efficient of lie of oxygen to the body but why is it useful it is useful in those animals that possess high energy needs as the constantly use energy to maintain their body temperature for example birds and mammals now you must be thinking that which side of the heart will contain oxygen which blood and which side will contain carbon dioxide which blood to get the answer of this query we should understand how or circulatory system works during blood circulation carbon digit which blood from the whole body enters the right atrium of the hear as the right atrium is filled with blood it contracts the tricuspid valve opens and the blood is pumped into the right ventricle of the heart not as the right ventricle contracts the pulmonary role opens and blood is pumped into the pulmonary artery which carries blood to the lungs for oxygenation the oxygenated blood from lungs which turns to the left atrium of the heart through the pulmonary veins when the left atrium is filled with oxgenated blood it can tracts and might well ball opens and the blood is pumped into the left ventricle now left ventricle contracts nd semilunar valves open the oxygenated blood is pumped into the other which distributes oxygenated blood to the rest of the body thus we have studied that in human beings the blood passes through the heart twice this type of circulatory system is called double circulatory system it is the most efficient way of circulation do you think that all animals possess ar for chambered heart the answer is now the body temperature of some animals such as infibians reptiles and fishes the tends on the temperature in the in van men in fibrins and reptiles possess three chambered heart which allows some mixing of the oxygenated and the oxygenated blood fishes possess are two chambered heart blood is pumped to the gills and is oxygenated there from gills blood passes directly to the rest of the body hence blood goes only bonds through the heart that circulation helps in the distribution of oxygenated blood to the tissues of the body and the heart is the most important component of the circulatory system,"['blood circulation carbon', 'blood fishes', 'heart blood', 'muscular organ', 'pumping organ', 'blood', 'human heart', 'lower chambers', 'carbon', 'animals such', 'semilunar valves', 'tricuspid valve', 'example birds', 'fingers inwards', 'mid line', 'chest cavity', 'apomp non', 'other substances', 'pulmonary', 'organ', 'human', 'ventricle', 'circulatory', 'energy', 'efficient', 'body', 'chambers', 'lower', 'fishes', 'heart', 'circulation', 'infibians', 'animals', 'other']"

Human Evolution, have you wondered about the prime cause for evolution well the molecular basis of evolution is the change in the structure of bean so if the de any of different species is compared there evolutionary proximity can be studied the most recent tool to study evolutionary relationships is ar measure of the anchange in species which is or magnitude of the among of the anacianged during the formation of species now we may think whether evolution is always in terms of advancement well evolution does not always mean progress or advancement the only progress is the emergent of more and more complex body designs of organisms over ages evolution just in compasses the production of diverse species and shaping the diverse species but in von mental selection sometimes speciation occurs from the existing population due to variations which ultimately leads to evolution in some examples the second population arises due to geographical barrier or distans while the mother population remains and both of them evolved together hence forth well natural selection acts on variations and over generations the most suited variation forms an new species so does it mean that all the designs are inefficient well the on series not always the simplest life forms are still alive yes we are taking about the bacteria which can survive in extreme in von mental conditions like hot springs deep sea thermal vents and the ice called intactica were even humans cannot survive in other words we can sada human beings are not the pnical of evolution but simply yet another species in the spectrum of evolving life now let us study about their evolution in detail before that lets know the tool which held to study evolution dees techniques are excavation radio carbon dating and the anysequincing excavation is aprosess in which specimens are data from the past varied under years of earth we di carbon dating is the process by which the age of inciens ample fossils is determined and third is the any sequencing in this method the de an examples are compared vi beanasequences of ancient specimens which shows the filogenetic relationship very clear lay so waters the study of human evolution suggest toking about human races we mainly focus on colours like black brown and white but it is not the biological basis for dividing human beings so all human beings belong to ar single species called homosapians it is interesting to know that we are all the descendents of are common primitive human being that originated in africa the homogenous has diversified from ostrelopitaces approximately two million years ago in africa they migrate in divergenines to various parts of the globe while the present in donation islands to fill opens and of spalia and then to america while the bearing land bridge many species of homo evolved homoerectes reach wesasia and central asia then they migrated to uracia south asia and east asia homoleunder telences cot spread to ore replacing populations of these two species modern homositions evolved around for lack to to lack fifty thousand years ago so over millions of years spreading and exploration continued this gave rise to many so called races of homosipians in different parts of the globe and eventually the most complex and developed species of earth evolved,"['bridge many species', 'springs deep sea thermal', 'human evolution', 'species modern', 'different species', 'asia homoleunder telences', 'primitive human', 'species', 'south asia', 'human', 'mental selection', 'evolution dees', 'excavation radio', 'different parts', 'asia', 'black brown', 'filogenetic relationship', 'ancient specimens', 'past varied', 'other words', 'suited variation', 'geographical barrier', 'only progress', 'ar measure', 'recent tool', 'prime cause', 'mental', 'evolution', 'replacing', 'ample', 'life', 'population', 'body', 'evolutionary', 'basis', 'excavation', 'selection', 'parts', 'many', 'ar', 'specimens', 'tool', 'progress']"
Image Formation by Lenses, lenses are almost everywhere around us whether it is acelphone alas for contact lens lenses are even used as magnifying glasses because they form the magnified image of the object which cannot be seen with the naked die par lens is the piece of ar transparent glass or plastic which two curved surfaces lens makes the light race to bend in as specific way as they pass through it whether the race can verge to we specific point or to diverge as if from as specific point the lenses are ar convex lens and ar concave lens when an object is placed in front of any of the two lenses then the image of that object is formed but how do the lenses from the image for this we will learn to draw ray diagrams which are extremely useful tules in objects the light race emerge from an object and we mark the parts as they pass through the lens the point where the meet is the point where the image will be on the characteristics of an image formed by lens are the ferent and depend on the position of the object lets consider acid dark as an object now how this object look like or where its image will be formed if it is placed in front of ar convex lens similarly what is the size or position of the object if we replace the convex lens with ar concave lens the answers to such questions become simple if we know how to draw the ray diagrams for different positions of the object when it is placed in front of either of the lenses let start with the convex lens when apalel beam of light race falls on ar convex lens such that these light rays are also paddle to the axes of the lens then these race after refraction can verge to as single point this point is called the principal focus of the convex lens due to this property ar convex lens is fall ar converging lens draw straight line representing the principal axes and mark the optical center oroughly on the centur of the principal axes now the car ruler and mark two points to the right of or name them as ef to and two to let if to is that three centimetre from or and to if to is double the distance dates at six intimate from the optical centero similarly on the left side of point or mark two points at same distance from or and name them as if one and two on now we will consider or as the optical centre of the lens and if one and ef to as its two principal for side draw the convex lens now before knowing about the ray diagrams for the image of the object formed by ar convex lens we need to on the stand three rules rule one ar ray of light from the object paddle to the principal axis after refraction from ar convex lens passes through the principal focus on the other side of the lens rule to ar ray of light passing through the optical center of aconexlens will emerge without any deviation rule three ar ray of light passing through or principal focus after refraction from ar convex lens will emerge pale to the principal axes let summarise the three rules with their ray diagram we can not is that the rule three is opposite of rule on this is due to the principle of reversibility of light now for the ray diagrams we need to drop two rays from the point on the object for this we need to choose the two rules of of three let supply the rules to know the position where letter size and nature of the image on suppose the tight dock is far away from the convex lens the dock will move on the principal axis and stop at different positions its image will change based on its position let see how suppose the dock is be on the point to one as we have to select the two rules of of three so from rule one the ray paddle to the principal axis after refraction passes through the forces for the second ray lets apply rule to the ray passes through the optical centre goes trait even after refraction the intersection of these two rays will represent the image of the head of the dark but where is the image of the remaining part of the dark right it lies on the principal axes so the is nonly to draw ace pre light ray from the botom of the image of the object remember that to know the cactoristics of the image we have to look for three points is the image real and inverted or virtual and upright is the image magnified diminished or of same size as the object and what is the position of the image so lets get back to our case where the object is beyond two on the image is real and inverted it is diminished and is formed between if two and two ef to for convenience and arrow can be used to drop the radagrams the arrow is inverted because an inverted image of dark is formed now the dock moves closer to the lens and stops at two one again we will use two rules out of three for the first ray we will apply rule one that is the ray paddle to the principalaxes after refraction will pass through forces for the second ray we will apply rule to that is the ray of light passing through the optical centre of the lens after refraction goes straight without any deviation the point of intersection of the two rays will help us to no the to cation of the image of the object looking at the image we can tell about its gate rises the image is formed at two to the image height is the same as the object hit the image is real and inverted now the duckmoves closer to the lens and stops between two one and one using the first two rules for image formation we can not is that the image of the dafomdis real inverted and magnified the image is formed beyond two ftwo the duckagain moves closer to the convex lens and stops at ef ne when the first two rules are applied for the formation of radigrams the two refracted rays are fed to be pale for does this indicate this indicates that the image is formed at infinite the image is real inverted and highly magnified now the dock further moves to words the convex lens and takes the position in between focus ef one and the optical center owe of the lens it is not is duct refracted rays are divergen if we produce the divergent rays takes then the image of the object seems to be highly magnified the special thing to not in this case is that the image is virtual and erect the image is formed behind the object this case of image formation proves that ar convex lens is used as coma find glass and so it is also use tin as simple microscope lets now see how aconcave lens forms the image of the object when he palel beam of light rays falls on the concave lens such that these light rays are also pale to the axis of the lens then these rays after refraction diverts the diverging rays when produce backwards appear to meet at ar point on the left side of the lens this point is called the principal focus of the concave lens due to this property ar concave lens is called are diverging lens similar to or convex lens we will draw as straight line that represents the principal axes again we mean to mark the points for the optical enter focus ne if two to one and two ef two for the points are at the samdistans with respect to ethother that is in between the two points the distance we have takin as three centimetre now if we compare the points of the concave lens with the points marked on the convex lens then it looks like days in case of ar concave lens if von and if two are on opposite sight as concept to convex lens if one and two have one are on the right side of the lens and if two and two if two are on the left side of the lens as we have certain rules for image formation in case of convex lenses we have rules for concave lenses to let say rule one ar ray of light which is paddle to the principal axis of ac concave lens after refraction appears to be coming from its forces rule to ar ray of light passing through the optical center of aconcave lens will emerge without any deviation rule tray ar ray of light passing through ar principal focus after refraction from ar concave lens will emerge pale to the principal axes let place the three rules of concave lens and compare them with rules of convex lens so for the image formation we will use two rules out of three suppose the dock is beyond to two for the first ray we will apply the rule one that is when array goes ple to the principalaxes then it gets diverged after refraction the refracted ray if extended it appears to come from the focus if two for the second ray lets apply rule to the ray going to vrts the optical centre goes straight without being deviated now we are do these two refracted rays meet since the rays are divergent we need to produse them bacud the point where the two rays meet is the image of the head of the dock the cause we have taken the rays from the top of the object the bottom part of the image will lie on the principal axes the image is formed in between the object and the lens what are the characteristics of the image formed the image is virtual and upright the image is diminished and is formed between the object and the lens now the duck moves closer to the lens and stops between ef two and two ftwo the image is again virtual and upright the image is diminished and is formed between the object and the lens the case of ac concave lens is simpler because wherever the object is placed the image is always the same let sum arise the image characteristics of the two lenses,"['ar concave lens', 'ar convex lens', 'ar principal focus', 'ar ray', 'lens rule', 'concave lens', 'convex lens', 'lens

Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors, why eating with the shining steel spoon you must have notes the reflection of your imagined but is the nature of the image formed the same as the one which is formed when you see youself in aplan mirror no lets on the than take shiny spoon at the pond place the pond in front of the inner curved surface of the boon and of serve with to reflection slowly take the spoon away and close to the pond thes the behaviour of image reflection remain the same no it changes now reverse the spoon and plays the pond in front of fat is the nature of the image formed the same as in the previous case no it is different its amazing but what exactly is happening why is that the images formed are some times enlarged the managed and inverted this is because spoon has the shiny surface which acts as he mirror and these types of mirrors are not exactly plain but curve this special class of mirrors is named as spherical mirrors lets understand this better in ar practical way take an huge perical glass shell cut as small piece out of it polishes outer curved surface of that it becomes shining potthelare of mortaray on the inner side so that no light can pass through it you will find that you have atin curved mirror with you as its some potaslike and outer curved surface of as on the mirror which we obtained through this process is ar convex mirror let us again take as spherical glass shell but as small piece out of it and this time thus do the opposite of what did earlier this time polishes in or crab surface and cot mol care on the outer surface the mirror which we obtained through this process as the concave mirror but the mirror is obtained at different properties to understand the properties of these spherical mirrors some points meet to be under stirs for any of the spherical mirror the centre point is known as pole which is generally denoted by the letter be you already know that ecor mirror is apart of augedperical glass shell so the centre of this spherical shell is the centre of cause and is generally express by the letters see remember that in the case of acovex mirror the centre of carater lie outside its reflecting surface but in ac gave mirror the centre of the whichelies in front of its reflecting surface if we join the centre of the water with the pole then this is the radius of curvature which generally express this by are now draw line that passes through the pole and the centre of curvature this is known as the principal axis it is the main access if we join the to both cal in points of ar curved mirror then it is called aperture of the mirror why we are getting familiar with these terms these terms are used to understand the image formation by spherical mirrors lets understand one of the important terms related to the spherical mirrors take concave mirror and direct its reflecting surface towards the sun you will find the shining rays reflecting from the mirror now take of paper as this cream and bring the mirror close to this green it just the screen and the mirrors to that all the rays are focus to obtain the bright sharp spot on the screen wait for human its or do you observe amazing the paper of the screen starts burning producing mol but what is the reason behind it for few minutes let keep it as side and understand this observation with the help of ar ray die gram take aconcave mirror draw ar principal axis passing through the pole they and centre operator see draw ar parallel ray of light striking at the surface of the mirror draw an normal this will pass through the centre of curvature ar cortilatro the reflected ray and recall the laws of reflection of light what do you observe yes you are right the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection light this take more parallel rays follow the same procedure and droureflected rays you will observe ar pattern the common observation for all these rays is that the all pass through the same point this point is called focas thus it can be concluded that all the rays which are parallel to the pons opalaxes pass through single point after reflection what about the distance which when the pole of the mirror the focus this this tons is called focal length now you might get the answer to the question why the papers starts burning when we directed the light rays reflected by the mirror on the paper screen the pale light rays from the sun yet converged that apointas he sharp bright spot by the mirror this point is the focus of the concave mirror the heat produced due to the concentration of sunlight at appointed night the paper so now you are clear about the focus of aconcave mirror but where it does the focus of convex mirror lie let us find out take ac convex mirror draw the incident ray pale to the principal axis draw an normal at this point it will pass through the centre of curvature accordingly draw the reflected ray ac convex mirror is he diverging mirror the ray look as if it is coming from as single point this is also in accordance with the law of reflection if we draw toward three more rays we see that all the reflected rays are coming from aspecial point fall focus this time also the distant between the pole and the focus is the focal length do you know there is he relationship between the focal length and the radius of curvature of as spherical mirror the radius of curvature is found out to be equal to twice the focal length this implies that the principal focus of ar spherical mirror lies mid ray between the pole and the centre of curvature let us now learn how to draw radians for the formation of images by ac concave mirror when an object is plays at different positions for drawing ray die grams three rules mass to be followed according to the first rule if arrays incident parallel to the principal axis then the reflected ray passes through the principal focus according to the second rule if the rays incident through the principal focus of the mirror the reflected rays parallel to the principal axis according to the third rule if an incident ray passes through the centre of carragre of camirror the reflected ray traces the same path let us now us plays laws to draw the ray grams if the object is at infinity then two rays parallel to the principal axis will incident on the concave mirror and after reflection ba the rays will converge at the focus the image formed will be point sized real and inverted if the object is placed beyond the centre of carat then from the head of the object draw ar ray parallel to the principal axis after reflection the ray will pass through the focus now from the head of the object draw another ray passing through the centre of curvature after reflection the ray will retrace its path at the point of interesection the image is formed it can be seen that the images diminishreal and inverted and is formed to between the centre of carragre and focus now if the object is placed at the centre of curvature from the head of the object one rays incident parallel to the principal axis and are the rise incident through the focus point after reflection the two rays meet at the centre of curvature fo this time the image is formed at the centre of car water it is seen sized in real and invrted now if the object is placed between centre of car water and focus incident one of the ray parallel to the principal axis and pass the other one through the focus after reflection the two rays meet at he point beyond the centre of car water so ar real inverted and magnified image is formed beyond the centre of curvature further if the object is placed at the focus the incident rays become parallel to each other after reflection and image is set to be formed at infinity the meter of the image is real and inverted and its size is per large as compared to obced further if the object is placed between the focus and the pole the two rays after reflection diode from each other so in order to join them we extend them behind the mirror thus the image formed in this cases virtual erect in magnified let verify these image formation by concave mirror through an activity the materials reito perform this aciityar acandle or class lamp two cardboard boxes large cardboard sheet white paper concave mirror meters cal and wooden frame lets now start performing the activity for this take the cardboard box large enough to hold the candle or land now cut off one side and place the candle in sided after this cut out narrow shape split from one side so that we get an arrow shaped light source make as screen of size twenty centimetre by thirty centimetre by taking of white paper on the card board sheet and set it up vertically with the help of the wooden frame fixed the mirror vertically on the other cardboard box by making as slit on its top surface now place the screen nearer window and please the mirror in front of it such that the image of the sun or some far away object is formed clearly on the screen measure the distance between the screen and the mirror and this situation this is the focal length of the mirror once the focal length is known in a dark room plae the mirror near the zero mark on the meter scale place the screen in front of it and place the light source in between the two so that the distance between the mirror and the source is alittle more than the focal length of the mirror it just the distance of the light source to obtain a clear image of the light source the image will be inverted and larger than the source as the image is often on the screen it is a real image this is similar to the case in whi we placed our object between centre of caratur and focus now move the source away from the mirror so that the distance between the two is greater than twice the focal length of the mirror get a clear image on the screen by moving it towards the mirror the image is inverted smaller than the object and real this is similar to the image formed by in object placed beyond the centre of curvatur similar to this we can verify the image formation by it dusting the distance between the source and the mirror after performing the activity let us now low in about image formation by are convex mirror when an object is placed anywhere between the infinity and pole of a convex mirror we obtain are diminished irtual and erect image behind the mirror between the pole and focus on the other hand if the object is at infinity then apointsized virtual and erect image is formed at the focus,"['ar spherical mirror', 'ar curved mirror', 'ar

electric current now passes through the straight copper wire from south to of direction what about the direction of deflection of needle of magnetic compass this time the needle of the magnetic compass deflects to words was the deflection in the needle the comes opposite when the direction of the current is reverse it means the direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reverse does the carton of magnetic field generated by electric current depend upon the that of the conductor to understand this first let us find out the pattern of the magnetic field around as straight current current conductor take or battery averiable resistance or are or start an ammeter ap plate connecting wires rectangular cardboard and ti copper wire insert the tic wire through the center normal to the plain of rectangular cadoad connect two ends of pcopperwire vertically in series with the lake battery ammeter and are as that now spring some iron filings seen form ly on the card board keep the variable of the rheostat at ar fixed position now close the key so that the electric current passes through the straight copper wire in ar direction say ex wire gently tap the card board of fucines and observe the pattern of iron filings what do you notes the iron filings or line tan cells showing concentric circles around the stretcopper wire these concentric circles represent magnetic field lines the nation of magnetic field is lag concentric circles having the essence along the axes of the conductor but how can the direction of the magnetic field be found show this place the magnetic compass at some point say be over ar circuit the direction of the no pole of the compass needle would give us the direction of field lines produced by the electric current through the straight copper wire at this point be the compass needle near the current carrying wire experiences or force that alines the needle tangent to a circle around the wire therefore ac current carrying wire produces circular loops of magnetic field if we change the direction of current by interchanging the connections of the battery the pattern of the magnetic field line will remain circular but the deflection of magnetic needle get revrse toes the deflection in the compass needle change upon in freezing of thicfasing the current she to see it were the current in the wire using reostat and no down the deflection in the needle by increasing the value of electric current in the straight wire the deflction of the needle also increases and similarly by decreasing the value of electric current in the straight wire the deflection of the needle decreases this indicates that the magnitude of magnetic field produced at at given instant of time is directly proposal to the magnetude of electric current flowing through a straight conducting wire now for the same fixed value of electric current if the compass is moved farther from the wire the deflection of the needle in the compass decreases the concentric circles around the straight conductor representing the magnetic field become larger and larger as we move away from it this shows the magnetic field produced for of fixed value of electric current in the conductor decreases as the distance from met increases but is there any way to find the direction of magnetic field produce due to current through a straight conductor when it is not wordical there is at convenient way called right hand can rule imagine that you are holding the current current straight conductor in your right hand so that the com points towards the direction of electric current the no fingers will rop around the conductor in the direction of field lines of the magnetic field this role is called the right hand tamrole magin that you are holding ar cock true in your right hand rotate this free head such that its tip at unces in the direction of electric current flowing in ar conductor the direction in which the thumb of the head of the through rotates gives the direction of magnetic lines of for magnetic fell due to or current through are circular loop when the current cring wire is trait then the magnetic field lines around it are concentric circles and the centers lie on the wire but will the latin of magnetic field lines remain the same if feman the feet wire in the shape of ar circular coil lets find out she first pass the vertical circular coil through or horizontal cardboard having two holds and the megatofreends of the circular coil in series with the bat re aplay and are of that sprinkle some an filings uniformly on cardboard plus the field to pass the current through acild next gentle up the cardboard and observe the patan of an filings emerged on the cardboard what do you observe in filings are arranged in ar circular loop this circular patent the presents magnetic field lines magnetic field lines are produce around the loop such that close to the wire the patan of magnetic fed lines is sircular but as we move to words the centre of the loop the circles become larger and larger by the tin we reach the centre of the circular loop the magnetic field lines are stride but how can the direction of magnetic lines of fore due to the current carrenes circular loop be found for that apply right hand tamrole for all convenience let us imagine that are circular wire loop is are complete circle and current is flowing anticlockwise let us consider once at section at this point in this section and nlectric current is flowing in the upward direction now hold this section of the coil with orbit hand such that the commas point in the direction of electric current the encircling fingers are running anticlockwise indicating the direction of the magnetic field so around this section the magnetic field lines would be anticlockwise like this similarly if we consider another section say at this point then current seems to be flowing in downwards then encircling fingers are running clockwise indicfating the direction of are magnetic field so around this section the magnetic field lines would be clockwise like this now the magnetic fed inside this imagine loop or ring is to words let and outside it is ride sin can be seen at the other end also inside the loop the magnetic fed lines are towards left and outside it the are to words the right direction when this is applied to eat section of the closed loop the field lines will look like this the magnetic field generated by the current carrying loop looks similar to the field feated by are tiny bar magnet from one side way nictric current is flowing in clockwise direction and magnetic field lines are entringit loop is the present in south pole of the bar magnet whereas wall obsirving from opposite side electric current is flowing in anticlockwise and magnetic field lines are leaving the loop representing not pole of the bar magnet this indicates that the current carrying loop acts like are tiny bar magnet thus by looking at the field lines of the circular loop the two poles not pole and the south pole of the circular loop can be mated magnetic field due to accurent in ar solenoid the magnetic field lines will become stronger if more loops are aided to the single loop but how could this magnetic field that perfect eel looks like or magnetic field of large bar magnet we are the magnetic field lines are straight inside let us find the magnetic field for two loops as magnetic field lines can never intersect so the total magnetic fell die to these two turns merge and ane magnetic field is formed which looks like this but field lines are immense and are not straight so to fit in the magnetic field lets at moturns to make it solenoid now we can see that the magnetic field inside the solenoid becomes almost straight the new magnetic field due to solenoid will resemble the magnetic field lines generated by the large bar magnet this coil which resembles the shape of or pipe or top is called as solenoid at german word we are sol on means pits and pots means shape when an electric current is passed through the solenoid it behaves like or bar magnet with one side as not pole end while another side as the south pole is the magnetic field is the same at all points inside the solenoid are strong magnet tic field produced inside of solenoid can be used to magnetize a piece of a magnetic material like soft iron when placed inside the coil the magnet so formed is called an electromagnet a solenoid is used in car door lacks an electric bells a magnetic field is generated when a voltage is applied to the solenoids finding the magnetic field of solenoid pulls the hammer causing it to strike the bell,"['magnetic field lines magnetic field lines', 'wire ar magnetic compass', 'circular wire loop', 'ar circular loop', 'ar ar

Magnetic Lines of Force, magnetic lines of poles magnetic field lines are useful for representing the direction and strength of the magnetic field the field lines are continuous and end less forming closed loops magnetic field lines are defined to start on the north pole of a magnet and end on the south pole inside the magnet they appear to move from south pole to north pole the magnetic field direction is the same direction acompos needle points when the magnetic compass is allowed to move in a magnetic field the needle always rests along the tangent to the curve,"['closed loops magnetic field', 'magnetic field direction', 'magnetic field', 'direction acompos', 'magnetic', 'direction', 'pole', 'field']"
Natural Means of Vegetative Propagation, have you ever observed the tiny plants that emerge from the patato or ginger note when you left them in kitchen for lone will of course most of us have seen that but what are they let us understand plant cells are uniquely bestowd with the capability to grow and form another mature plant under favourable conditions this grapety of plant cells is utilised by horticulturest or plant goes to raise and new plant without any genetic variation in comparison to the parent plant can you tell what this method is called it is called vegetative propagation so vegetative propagation and plants can be defined as at type of asexual reproduction wherein the vegetative part slike stem leaves and buds give rise to new plants so do we give any spetial name to these structures yes these structures are called vegetative propagules now question might be coming to your mind that vegetative propagation can only occur naturally no it can be done artificially to basically vegetative propagation cars in two ways it is done either naturally by underground roots stems sub areal stems at seta or it can also be done artificially by stem or root cutting grafting or bieticenolegical method like micropropagation first let us understand different methods of vegetative propagation by natural means in nature vegetative propagation occurs by vegetative propagules such as runner or stolen rise om ball corm tuber and offset that quickly see an example of each stoolens or runners are the modified horizontal stems as the name suggests in this method of vegetative propagation are long slender lateral brand originates from the underground stem and runs about the ground can you name any plant which propagates in this manner the strawberry plant propagates with the help of horizontal stem now let us see another example when you see or ginger what do you observe will you can see it is irregular in shape it is an horizontal stem it is found underground as you can see some modern it plants like gingre show vegetative propagation with rise one so we can define rhizome as an irregular shape underground horizontal stem which serves as of storage organ and also at as ar means of vegetative propagation both stolen in rise om are horizontal stems can you list futivferences between the two yes your right stolen is asubberial stem while risomisan underground stem moving on to the next lets understand ball here we are talking about and underground modified stem which is involved in vegetative propagation it stays in dormant condition under the unavailablity of water however during favourable conditions they are apical bud produces leaves and flat whereas the lateral buds produce new shoes only an and garlic are some of the common examples of balbers plants the next type of vegetative propagules is com it is enlarged ball like modification of underground stem com remains in dormant condition but under favourable conditions buds of com produce new plants can you give an example of car yes the colocatia plant which you find in your garden is an example of corms as both corms and balls are underground stored structures can is potemain difference between the two well always remember that ball bus an underground swollen stem with layers of modified leans whereas are com is of solid swollen stem with externally visible nodes and internodes the next is tuber tubers are vegetative organs that matdevelop from stems or roots and order to store food potato is the most common example of tuber these underground stems grow horizontally in the soil and food materials like starch is stored within them but do you wonder from where the new plant arises and potato well to understand this let see the struct or of potato carefully on the surface of potato leaf cars are present which enclose the axillary buds these leaf cars are also called the eyes of potato each eye develops into a new plant when the tube is planted have you ever observed the tiny plants growing on the edge of aleaf well in some plants miniature young plants arise from the leaf margins on reaching maturity these plants fall of and grow into a new plant can you name aplant which propagates in this manner well bryophylum propagates through this method the next one is offset have you ever heard about the plant called the terror of pincall can you tell why is it called so well water hyacinth is known as the terror of bingall because within very short period of time it covers the entire surface of water body and deprives other equatic organisms from light and oxygen do you know how it propagates so quickly well it propagates with the help of offset offsets are short lateral shoots which bear clustered leaves at the tips another plant which propagates through offset is pistire all the methods we studied till now are the natural methods of vegetative propagation but what if we want any particular plant at particular time or any particular characteristic of a plant in this method artificial method of vegetative propagation helps us to achieve the desired result,"['underground swollen stem', 'underground horizontal stem', 'underground

Refraction of Light, light seems to travel along street line paths in transparent medium when light enters from one transparent medium to another it still goes in as straight path but it bends due to change in its speed before knowing in detail lit recall some of our day to day experiunce based on the same medium ap pencil partly immusden water in aglasstumbler appears to be displaced at the interface of air and water when a thick glass lab is placed over some printed matter the letters appear raised when viewed through the glass la but why does this happen this happens due to the refraction of light let us understand this beginning with the case of the apart displacement of the pencil partly immersed in water the light reaching the observers eye from the potion of the pencil inside water seems to come from are efferent direction compared to the part above water this make the pencil appear to be displaced at the interface for similar reasons the printed letters appear to be rays when seen through or glass la placed over it these pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent if instead of water some other depid such as carowscene or terpentine is used will the printed letters appear to right to the same height if the glass la is replaced with atransparent plastic slab well the unceras no this is because the extent of the effect is different for different pairs of transparent media when light travels obliquely from one transparent medium to another the direction of propagation of light in the second medium changes though light travels in as rate line this finominent is cold as refraction of light the extent of the change in direction of light that takes place in a given pair of media may be express in terms of refractive index refractive index explains relative speed of light in different media light changes its direction because it speed is different in different media for example the speed of light is fastest in vacuum which is three into ten to the pave eight meter persecm this speed of light in air is only marginaly less compared to that in vacuum it reduces considerably in glass and water if see is the speed of light in air and we is dispeed of light in the medium then the refractive index of the medium is equal to speed of light in air the lighted lights bed of light in the medium which is equal to see divided by ve this is called the absolute refractive index of the medium litre of on activity based on refraction of light the materials record for this activity are ashallowbold acoin and water lac the ladshalobole on the level surfand put the coin in it slowly move away from the bold stop as soon as the coin just disappears from your sight now askibrother to bolwater gently into the bold without disturbing the coin the placing for the coin from the position wear you have stopped what do you observe the coin again becomes visible when water is poured into the bowl the coin appears slightly race above is actual position this is due to refraction of light now lets understand the phenomenon of refraction of light through radigrams the is consider two optical mediums one as air and another as glass suppose ray of light travels from air to glass and then from glass to war when array of light rights the air glass interface it speed changes due to which it bends again when the same ray of light travels further and strikes the glass interface it immorges out with the same speed with which it entered the glass from aa if we draw an normal at the two interfaces then we will observe that when light ray goes from ar rarer medium to at denser medium it bends to words the normal due to its lesser speed in denser medium an when it goes from denser to rarer medium it bends away from the normal due to increase in its speed in rarer medium the bending of light is due to change in its speed this bending of light when it enters from one optical medium to another optical medium is called refraction of light the angle which the incident ray make with the normal is called angle of insidums the angle which the refracted ray makes with the normal is called angle of refraction be tarthe angle of incidence and angle of refraction same when light passes from one optical medium to another no the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of incidents when light passes from optically denser medium to optically rarer medium this is because the rear flight bends away from the normal as its speed increases let us understand the case of a pencil which appears to be displaced from its actual position with the help of ar radigram when a straight pencil emon is immersed obliquely in water its position seems to appear at em one and one under the water the rays of light from the point in are travelling from water to air that is from denser medium to rarer medium they bend away from the normal after refraction at the surface they appear to be coming from point in one which is true for each and every point of the part of the pencil which is immersed in water similarly the height of the letter appears to be raised when a glass slab is placed over it or akin appears raised when placed inside the water hence refraction can make an object appear to be at adifferent position refraction of light has many other applications such as rainbow twinkling of stars and refraction in

Refraction through Rectangular Glass Slab, you must be knowing about refraction of light which takes place due to change in the speed of light as the enters from one transparent medium to another having different optical densities lets understand the phenomenon of refraction of light through an experiment with the help of given meters fix of paper on or wooden board with the help of both which place are tangled glass slab in the middle of the she take the pencil and draw the outline of the glass slab name it as abcd now remove the glass slab and draw al line it othinlined to edge ab i owe is the incident ray draw an normal and one end to at the point of incidence to the two pens be one and bto fixed them on the incident ray i owe please the glass slab again on its initial position that is ab cd looking from the other side cd of the glass slab fixed two pens pthre and before such that these two pens and the images of pins be one and be to lie on as trait lime now remove the glass slab and the pins encircle the pen prac of be one be to be three and before join the points be three and before and the extend the line to made the edge cd at point or prime to prime is the emergent ray join or or prime the ray or or prime is the refracted ray draw up or penticular am one end to to cd at or prime measure the angle of incidents eye angle of refraction are and the angle of emergence what do you observe it is observed that the angle of incident i is greater than the angle of refraction are an angle of incidents is equal to the angle of emergent when the emergent ray or pine is extended back words you will notice that it is parallel to the incident ray do you know why it is due to the fact that at the opposite barrel faces of the glass slab the maximum bending of the ray of lie is equal and opposite however the emergent ray is shifted slightly side word this displacement is non as lateral displacement lateral displacement increases with the increase in the thickness of the glass block angle of the incidents and refractive index of the medium from the experiment it is observed that the light bends towards the nrmal when it travels from air to glass that is from rarer medium to dencermedium and away from the normal when it travels from glass to air that is from denser medium to rarer medium on the basis of several experiments it is concluded that the refraction of light is based on two laws the first law states slab the incident ray the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane and the second law states that the ratio of line of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is the constant for the light of agiven colour and for the given pair of media this constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first this law is also non as snails law of refraction the snails law is true for angle of incidences between zero and ninety degrees do you know how al light ray is affected if it incidents normally to the interface of the two media the light ray will pass on deviated but its speed will wear,"['al light ray', 'side cd', 'glass block angle', 'transparent medium', 'second law', 'second medium', 'light ray', 'eye angle', 'glass slab', 'law', 'medium', 'several experiments', 'refractive index', 'maximum bending', 'prime measure', 'pen prac', 'trait lime', 'initial position', 'wooden board', 'meters fix', 'ray', 'side', 'cd', 'displacement', 'barrel', 'optical', 'al', 'slab', 'light', 'glass', 'angle', 'transparent', 'same', 'prime']"
Respiration in Fish, fish are aquatic animals water contains oxygen dissolved in it depending on temperature and at their factors the level of dissolved oxygen in water is about for to fiftenmiligrams per liter fish extracted this dissolved oxygen from the surrounding water by acrosers called aquatic respiration fish have fish lie structures called gills to carry out exchange of gases with water the gills are located on either side of the head of fish behind the mouth cavity in bony fish the gills are covered by a hard bony flap called the operculum it is also known as gill cover in cartilagineous fish the operculum mis lacking and the individual openings to gills are called gill slits during the process of exchange of gases of fish first got water through its mouth at the time of the intake of water the mouth opens while the operculum remains clothes the fish then closes its mouth and open thoroculum to force the water out through the gills the colour of the gills is dark red or brown red because of the presence of a large number of blood capillaries in it these capillaries come in close contact with the current of water crossing the gills blood absorbs the dissolved oxygen from the water by diffusion the unique structure of the gills and shows that the absorb most of the oxygen dissolved in the water that is passing between them simultaneously carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses out of the gill capillaries into the water the water containing carbon dioxide is expelled through the open operculum besides being the respiratory organs the gills also play an important role in maintaining the balance of salts and fish fishes like blue gill sea horse line fish atlantic called posters the hard cover of operculum the best example of of fish having no operculum mis shark all the fishes of shot lack operculum and have only gills lids,"['bony fish', 'fish lie', 'fish', 'lack operculum', 'open operculum', 'operculum mis', 'gill', 'aquatic animals', 'gills blood', 'hard bony', 'unique structure', 'close contact', 'large number', 'individual openings', 'mouth cavity', 'operculum', 'red', 'open', 'gills', 'aquatic', 'hard', 'blood', 'absorb', 'mouth']"

The Principle of Electromagnetic Induction, the principle of electromagnetic induction you might have seen and electric power generator used to produce electricity or ar transformer uses to change to oic current to he high voltage current the principle the cold in the working of these the axes is the electromagnetic induction according to this prints for the changing magnetic field line with circuit can generate and induced emit in the circuit to on the turn the concept of electromagnetic induction ar series of experiments poor formed by maofarraget and doses henry let study ar ma these experiments one by one current induced by or moving magnets the the conducting material such as the coil above about magnet and the galvanometer the net these component use in connecting wires now move the bar magnet towards the coil at the magnet moves towards the coil the magnetic flux length with the coil takes magnetic free line cross in the coil for second increases an due to this and eamefisinduced in the coil this induced emit in turn reduces an induced current in the coil this induced current in the circuit is shown ane deflection in the galvanometer as the that by the glowing call when the magnet moves away from the coil the flux length with the coil decreases again due to this decrease in the magnetic flux and induce teams and hence induced current is generated in the coil however the deflection in the galvanometer in this case is opposite to that in the previous case this shows that not the current is flowing in ar direction opposite to the previous case also it can be seen that when the magnet is stationary no current flows in the coil as about does not glow and the galvanometer shows no deflection hence it is clear that in order to generate induced current in the circuit magnet should on moving towards or away from the coil so that the magnetic flux link with the coil is on changing it can be observed that on increasing feet of the magnet the deflection in the galvanometer increases and the both flows cite indicating and increase in the magnet uk to of induced current the direction of induced current can well be understood by lenses law then is law according to the lenses law the direction of induced current in the coil is such that it apposes the coils due to it it is produced when not pole of the magnet moves to word the coil the flux link with the coil increases hence the current in the coil flows in the direction such that its end near the magnet at as the north coil so as to decrease the magnetic flux of the coil when not pole of the magnet moves or was from the cold the magnetic flu length with the coil increases hence the current in the coil flows in the direction such thagnecs and near the magnet as as the south coil so as to increase the flags of the coil similarly when out pole of the magnet moves towards the coil the flux length with the coil increases hence the current in the coil flows in the direction such that its end near the magnet at as the south coil so as to decrease the magnetic flux of the coil when south pole of the magnet uses away from the coil the magnetic flat ln with the coil decreases hence the current in the coil flows in direction such that its end near the magnet at the not cold so as to increase the flux of the coil induced current due to the moving coil we have seen that are moving magnet can generate and induced current in the coil do you think that such generation of induced current is possible when the coil moved to world or away from or fixed magnet hikeabarmagnet the pen did from ar clamp tan as set up contain of ac coil but and galvanometer connected through the connecting boils now move the coil to words the magnet you will see that the ball cos and the galvanometer shows deflection again when coil is moved away from the magnet the ball loses and galvanometer shows deflection however the lection in the galvanometer in this case is opposite to that in the previous case that when coil move to world or away from the magnt the magnetic lacks wing with the coil changes and as ores at and induced current flows in the coil the direction of current in this case also obeys the lenses la that is it flows in direction such that it opposes the cause of the generation also increasing this be of the coil the deflection in the galvanometer increases and the bolt close cite indicating and increase in the magnituof induced current current induced due to current take or coil ar battery and the white connected in the circuit with the help of connecting wire take another coil but and galvanometer connected together with the help of connecting boils now such on the battery so that ar currents that flowing in the first coil and the magnetic field is generated around this coil now move the second coil to words or away from the first coil you will observe that the ball be the second coil flows and the galvanometer shows the flection this as again due to the same reason that when the second coil is in motion relative to the first coil the magnetic flat line tet changes and hands an emit is induced in the second coil as can be seen from the deflection in the galvanometer and the direction of induced current when the second coil moves at from the first is opposite th that when the second coil moves to words the first coil the direction of the current can in this case also be found using lenses law also the gamete in the coil can be induced in the similar way in the second this get stationary and the first coal is moved to words or away made avering current in the coil can generate and induced emit in the coil near by it as the current in the coil are the tent of magnetic field generated cite also varies and hence the facts link with the second coil chain this change in flat generates induced eamth in the coil apart from tesexperiments the found by henry and farad eameth can also be induced by gangineria of the coil pyroteting it in amagnetic field when he coil rotation abagnetic feel the number of feet flint crossing the coil barssecont chain and therefore the flulintrith the coil changes contineous late acoting to the farad law is continuous leaching in magnetic flux will generate and induced ea met and hence and induced current in the coil the direction of e induced current in this case can be given by flemings right hand rule fleming's right hand rule according to the flemings right hand rule if we stretch the index finger come and the middle finger mutually perpendicular to each other such that the index finger points along the direction of magnetic field and comes along the direction of motion of the conductor then the middle finger gives the direction of induced current from all these experiments we can conclude that whenever the flux linked with the coil changes and induced ms is generated in the coil this induced emf gives rise to an induced current the direction of this induced current always opposes the change in flocs also the magnitude of the induced current is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flocs,"['coil ar', 'magnetic flat line', 'second coil flows', 'second

and egestion body taken into the body through the mouth the process of taking food into the body is called ingestion digestion of carbohydratlike starch begins in the buccal cavity the buccal cavity held in mastication and swallowing of food fluid called saliva is secreted by the salivary glands food is broken into smaller molecules and make purely with saliva and motor round the mouth while chewing by date and muscular tongue mucus and saliva ubricets and adhesthe food particles into abolas the saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that breaks down starch which is the complex carbohydrate into its sugar subunits about thirty per cent of the stages hydro lies in the or cavity into maltose the bolus ten ones into the fares and then into the esophagus by following epiglottis prevents the entry of food into the wind by the bolus passes down to esophagus bisecseeding wave of muscular contraction called peristalsis the gastro is opagiosfincta controls the passage of food into the stomach the bolus now enters the stomach the mucosa of stomach has gastric glands the gastric glands consist of three major types of cells these are mucus necells which secrete mucus peptic or chief cells which secrete pro enzyme pepsinogon and borate or acetic cells which secrete hydrochloricaced and intrinsic factor essential for absorption of vitamin be twel various secretions by stomach cells inicalydages the bolus proenzyme pepsinogen is converted into it satifom pepin that converts proteins into their subunits proteoses and peptones muscular contractions in the stomach gene content to further re down the bolus and mixed with stomach secretions to former thick liquid called chyme exit the stomach through the pyloric sphincter and enters the small intestine bile from the liver and digestion sines om the pancreas is released into the dudonum of the small intestin through the hepato pancreatic duct the various pancreatic and sisatripsinogion chymotrypsinogen procarboxypeptidases emmaleses lipases and nucleases trypsinogen is converted into active tripsen by the action of an enzyme interocnes secreted by the intestinal new coca trypsin in turn activates ate enzymes in the pancreatic geese bile contains be pigments bile sols cone straw and postolipids bile helps in emulsification of fats and help sin activation of lipases intestinal mucosa has goblet cells which secrete mucus the secretion of brush border cells of mucosa along with the secretion of goblet cells constitute the intestinal jewsor succus entericus succus entericus contains enzymes like disaccharidases dipeptidases lipases nucleosidases it seta mucus alongwith the bicarbonates from the pancreas protect the intestinal mucosa from acid and provide aniline medium for enzymatic activities proteins peptones and broti ocess that are partially hydrolysed brotines in the chyme reaching the intestine are acted upon by proteolytic enzymes of the pancreatic jews to form di peptides cabohydrets in the chyme are hydrolysed by the pancreatic amylase into disaccharides fats are broken down by lipases with the help of bile into di and monoglycerides nucleases and the pancreatic jews act on nucleic acids to form nucleotides and nucleosides the enzymes in the succus into recas atom the end products of all the reactions to form the respective simple absorbable subunits the simple substances thus formed are absalled in the jejunum and ileum regions of the small intestine absorption is the process by which the end products of digestion pass through the intestinal mucosa into the blood or limb absorption of substances take place in different parts of the elementary canal but maxima absotion occurs in the small intestine various nutrients like carbohydrates and proteins are absorbed into the blood capillaries bats being insoluble cannot the absorbed into the load they are first incorporated into small droplets called micelles which move into the intestinal mucosa they are reformed into very small protein coated paddlopios called cilomicrons which are trasported into lacteals in the villi these lim vessels ultimately release absorbed substances into the blood stream the absorbed substances finally reach the tissue and this processes called assimilation the undigested and unabsorbed substances called the sees are passed to the large intestine the sees then enter into the secum of the large intestine through the eliosecal vale which prevents its back flow in the large intestine absorption of water minerals and certain drugs takes place it also secretes mucus which helps in adhering the waste particles together and lucrecating it for an easy passage fecal matter is temporarily stored in the rectum till defication the digestive wastes in the rectum

Plant Tissue culture, we al know that all over the world there are thousands of intermix plants that are at the words of extinction but have you ever wondered how we can conserve these and demicplants from extinction the conservation sign tests are using various techniques thes tan genetics and molecular biology these techniques can help us and preserving the plants for medicinal and other purposes do you know any such techniques of preserving plants yes one of such technicis plant tissue culture the plant tissue culture is based on the principle of cell totipotency now the question arises what is totipotency to the potency means that each an every cell of or plant is capable of generating new plants that are genetically identical to the parent plant plant tissue culture is to collection of techniques used to mentinor grow plant cell tissues or organs under sterile conditions on an nutrient culture medium this technique is widely used to generate plones of aplant with desired carturestate this method is also called micro propagation now let us have alike into the various steps in volt in disticnetes the first step is preparation of instruments and nutrient medium in this step all culture vessels or glass where are clean an sterolites all glass where and plastic where are washed in various steps after washing all the glass where like petri plates flask pepsi seta they are sterilis in an hot air on at one sixty to one eightydegree sentegrate for two to four hours the next step as preparation of culture media ar culture media contains all the micro elements and growth regulators required for the growth of ar plant the cultrmedium for plant tissue culture is are semi solid medium of agar after preparation of culture medium it is steralized by or to cave machine at fifteen beside for thirteen minutes the next step in the plant tissue culture is selection of an explant do you know what an explantes any part of the plant for example petal leave node both at seta that can be used to generate new plant us called and explant here of small plant stem is used as explant while selecting an explant it is important that the explant must be held the young disease free and should have meristematic area after collection explants are kept in water immediately now the explant is ready for the nextep of inoculation do you know what inoculationats inoculation is the process of transfer of an explant into the nutrient media under asepteccondation the cabinet of lamina are flow provides the septa condition for inoculation before starting the process of inoculation in the cabinet of laminariflo the cabinet is steralized by switching pond new we like for about the ti minutes after sterilisation the explant is washed and seventy person to an all for about thirtysecents in laminarerflo elaf and then was to with mild disinfectant solution of sodium hypochlorite for few minutes after treating with sterilising agent the solution is decanted into ar was beaker and the explant is washed several times with distilled water to remove traces of sodium hypochlorite now the explants or transport into the petri plate containing filter paper to remove excess water the explants are then part into small pieces with the help of forceps and calteleach nodan segment is then inoculattedt carefully into the petri plate for the stu containing nutrient media after inocultion the stu were conical flask is sealed tightly now the next step is incubation in this step inoculatenex plants are captainaculta lamp at about twenty fa to twenty seven

develops during tissue culture of plant parts and is induced py hormone treatment once the shoots or routes the next step with hardening now let us try and understand what is hardening hardening is the process of gradual exposure of plantlets for exclamatization to an vinemental conditions for this step plantlets are transferred to green house and are subjected to different types of in fine

Osmosis And Osmotic Pressure, have you ever for on the fragrance of the perfume spreads in the room when you spray it on your body think about it it is due to ar process called diffution diffusion utersmonpotical spread when you spray perfume the particles of the perfume more freely until they are equally spread in room so diffusion is at process of movement of apes and or molecules from the region of their higher concentration to the region of their lower concentration can you tell why reasons get swells on leaving in water for some time is it also due to diffution no it happens due to another phenomenon known as osmosis it is the flow of slvant through a semipermeable memory from pure solvent to the solution that is from the region of its lower concentration to higher concentration we can see the level on the more concentrated side of the memory is rising while the one on the less concentrated side is falling if the sides of the memory have equal concentration the amount of solvent going in and going out will be the same so at this point the net exchange of water is zero and there is no fther change in the liquid levels we can stop the flow of the solvent from its side to solution side across the semipermeable memory by applying some extra pressure on the solution this minimum pressure that stops the osmosis is called osmotic pressure of the solution it is the noted by by by is equal to se rt hi is equal to in by the rt by in to be is equal to in rt and therefore is equal to se rt whereby is osmotic pressure see is concentration of the solution is the gas constant and is the temperatuore therefore we can see that osmotic pressure is dependent on the concentration of the solution students can you guess what happens if or pressure larger than the osmotic pressure is applied on the solution side yes now the process of osmosis is reverse pure pre slvanflows out of the solution through the semi permeable memory we all know sea water is salty and we cannot use it for drinking purpos pure reverse osmosis is used to obtain potable water from sea water in fact reverse osmosis is base finding use in commercial and residential water purifies,"['pure reverse', 'reverse pure', 'diffution diffusion utersmonpotical', 'pressure', 'permeable memory', 'solution side', 'water', 'pure', 'gas constant', 'rt hi', 'liquid levels', 'fther change', 'net exchange', 'ar process', 'concentration', 'reverse', 'side', 'solution', 'memory', 'diffusion', 'rt', 'process', 'diffution']"

Rational Numbers Between Two Rational Numbers, you have been learning about the numbers since beginning you add subtract multiply and to vi them four exumber betweo at two numbers say seven and in even and divide this sumby two then what do you get of course an number that is nine lets think about this number sells this number is the mean of these two numbers seven and eleven in general the mean of eight and be is eight plus be upon two another important thing is that it lies between the two numbers is it true if we divide this sumby three or any other number now take one or in snumber some of four and five is nine now divide nine by three you get three clearly three does not lie between four and five for another two numbers two and seven if we divide their sumby three we get three which lies between two and seven so the resulting number may or may not lie between the two numbers however this is always true for dividing as sum of two numbers by two the resulting number lies between the two numbers we can use this concept to find nout numbers between any two given numbers so lets find out sum numbers between four and five add four and five and divide this sum by two so we get four point five observe that four point five is an number between four and five now consider four and four point five here summers eight point five now divide this sum by two we get four point two five for point to five is another number between four and five now consider four and four point two five their sum is eight point two five now divide this sum by two we get four point on two five four point on to five is another number between four and five do you think that this will ever en now this is an never ending process what does it mean it means that there are infinite numbers between any two numbers when we say any number we talk about all rational numbers or so take any two rational numbers in fractional for say one upon five and three upon five their summers four upon five now divide this by two we get two upon five this is are rational number between one upon five and three upon five now take one upon five and two upon five their sums three upon five now divided by two we get three upon ten three upon ten is ar rational number between one upon five and three upon five similarly we can find many rational numbers between these two rational numbers using this method you can find many more rational numbers between any two rational numbers now we this question carefully and find two fin the nand see how many national numbers are there between two and ten observe that the question us about national numbers not numbers so there are only seven national numbers between two and ten lets understand another metrs to find out rational numbers between any two rational numbers take these two rational numbers first step is to make denominators same to do so we find the least common be pale of five and ni least common mol to pl of five and nine is forty five so we multiline numerator and denominator of this number by nine and numerator and denominator of this number by five observe that sum numbers between the two numbers are twenty eight upon forty five twenty nine upon forty five thirty upon forty five thirty one upon forty five and so on up to sixty four upon forty five can you find sumbore numbers between these two of course you can to find sum or numbers find ycovelent rational numbers by multiplie numerator and denominator by ten after making the denominators same so some more numbers between the given numbers are two seventy one upon for fifty two seventy two upon four fifty two seventy three upon four fifty and so on up to six forty nine on four fifty observe what you are doing here you are increasing the denominator and numerator so that you can easily find more numbers between the given rational numbers can you find some more numbers between these two numbers yes you can so lets further increase the denominator here we find equivalent rational numbers by multiplying numerators and denominators of the rational number by one hundred this time observe we are multiplying numerator and denominator by one hundred after making the denominators same why are we multiplying only by ten and one hundred every time to find the equivalent rational numbers because it makes are calculation easy otherwise you can find equivalent rational number by multiplying numerators and denominators by any number find some rational numbers between three and four here you do not need to make the denominators same because they are already same here you directly need to find equivalent rational numbers so lets multiplying numerators and denominators by nine here you can clearly see that the numbers between three and four are twenty eight upon nine twenty nine upon nine thirty upon nine up to thirty five upon nine if you are asked to find more numbers between three and four then find other equivalent rational numbers by multiplying numerator and denominator by or number more than nine so here you have seen how the concept of mean and equivalent rational number are useful in finding out numbers between two given rational numbers using these concepts you can easily infer that there are infinitely many rational numbers between any two rational numbers,"['rational numbers first', 'rational numbers', 'national

Refraction of Light through Prism, ar triangular prism can be considered as apes of glass far from awide bottom glass slab or from any other transparent object it is bounded by two triangles surfaces and three rectangles surfaces which are known as the refracting surfaces the prisms are available with bearing angles for example ritangled prism in prism eilatralpriso etcetera let the monochromatic light ray be incident on the refracting surface at the point known as the point of incidents when litres incident on the surface it gets refracted at the two rectangles surfaces the angle between the two refracting surfaces incnownas the angle of prism an line drawn perpendicular to the surface the point of incidents is known as the normal the angle that is incident ray makes we the normal is the angle of incidents at this point the rays suffers first refraction at the ranges from ar rarer to at tends ar medium it tends towards the normal along few are making an angle are with the normal the angle that the refracted ray make with the normal is known as the angle of refraction the refracted ray is incident on the other refracting surface at sea at an angle or das this time it goes from an denser medium to ar rarer medium and hence bends away from the normal finally emerging along or as at an angle of emergent the emergent ray is always directed towards the base of the rise in the pons of the prism the light ray with travel along be cue dee ba the presence of prism in its part deviates the light ray from ice del to be ge or date through an angle delta all the angle of divation the angle between the extended incident ray and the extended emergent ray gives us the deviation suffered by the light ray the angle of incidence angle of emergent angle of deviation and the angle of prism are related abording to the formula hi plate is equal to blast delta variation in the angle of deviation with the angle of incidents the variation in the angle of deviation with the angle of incidents can be stated easily by drawing the grave between the angle of deviation delta and the angle of incidents hi slowly increase the angle of incidents and observe the parts of the refracted ray and the emergent ray for each case as the angle of incidents where we observe ovariation in all the angles and delta the case shown on the screen as of minimum deviation and after this the angle of divation further stout to increase that initially the angle of deviation decreases with the increase in the angle of incidents attains the minimum value and then again starts increasing with further increase in the angle of incidents and the point of minimum deviation we observe that the angle on incidents is equal to the angle of emergions and the refracted ray is parallel to the base of the prism let us now study about the person which is the phenomenon of splitting of white light into its complement colours on passing to are present place ea prism on horizontal surface and the source of white light on its left place card board with small hole to twin the source of white light and the prism this arrangement produces an narrow beam of white light on the other sight of the prism place screen to obtain the emergent rays on it we obtain of coloured batting on the screen in the order represented by the acronim with cure the band of seven colours known as the spectrum of white light this formed tigers the different colours present in white light in refracted and different angles this happens because the refractive en eggs of the prism and hence the angle of refraction is different for different wave lens of incident light this leads to different angles of deviation for each of the constituent colour of the white light while at colour suffering the maximum deviation,"['other refracting surface', 'prism place', 'place card', 'incident light', 'refracting surfaces', 'emergent angle', 'different colours', 'deviation delta', 'light ray', 'emergent ray', 'ar medium', 'incident ray', 'angle delta', 'other transparent', 'different wave', 'minimum deviation', 'prism eilatralpriso', 'refracting surface', 'bottom glass', 'place', 'coloured batting', 'narrow beam', 'small hole', 'further increase', 'ice del', 'first refraction', 'light', 'emergent', 'incident', 'surfaces', 'other', 'different', 'deviation', 'prism', 'colours', 'hi', 'dee', 'delta', 'medium', 'ar', 'angle', 'glass', 'ray', 'surface', 'minimum', 'further', 'increase', 'refraction']"
Introduction to Plant Cell, as cell is defined as the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism however due to functional requirements plan cells differ in several key features from the cell of other ducariotic organisms plan cells have number of specialised structures including are rigid cell wall central vacuole lasmodesmata and chloroplasts the adomanfeatures it shares with an mol cells are cell membrane nucleus matocantria golgi body endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes cell ball in plants forms and outer limiting layer of the plan cell and gives definite shape to the plant cell it also protects the cell from any mechanical injury certain openings called plasmodesmata are left in the cell bolturing development these openings connect the cytoplasm of edges an cells inotipicacel cell of plasma membrane situated next to the sella defines the boundary of the cytoplasm cell membrane is mainly made up of lipid pale in which protein molecus are embedded the membrane is selectively pomiebl in nature and thus regulates the flow of materials into and out of cells the part of the protoplasm present between the cell membrane and nucleus is called cytoplasm cytoplasm is transparent white colelesflued and is the site of various biosynthetic reactions itesnatstatec and show ciclaces the streaming movement in the cat place various or genes are present plastids are one of the largest cytoplasmic organelles that are found only in plan cells three major types of plastids are recognise leucoplasts or colelesplastds which are located in roots and non proto synthetic tissues of plants chromoplasts or caloplastets which impart collar to flare and fruits chloroplast green colour plates that are found in all green parts of the plants like lives young branches stems and sepals plastids per found important by logical function of can testes of food and storage of carbohydrates proteins and lipids chloroplasts are the most widely arguing plastids in the plants in higher plants shape of chloroplast may be fecal oval discoid or baconvets chloroplast is an dub membrane structure measuring about for to ten micrometers in diameter and one to three micrometers in thicknes the space limited by the inner membrane of the chloroplast is called metric or stroma stroma contains number of state sac like structure non as filacoids which are arranged as pits of points stacked one above the ate eatstacis called guenam falacoids of two quena are connected by stroma lamina or fed membranes the palacoid membrane is impregnated with for to synthetic pigments chloro fell chloro fr ill is the queen pigment common to all photosynthetic cells which allows leaves to obtain energy from line in plants photosynthesis take place within chloroplasts when delay from the sun strikes at chloroplast it uses litienergy to combine carbon divide and water the molecular reaction creates sugar or glucose and oxygen ate plants uses sugar or glucose as their food and energy for the rod mitocontria mitocontri are present in all ucariotic places their number varies from cell to cell in plants their number is more in actively dividing merismetic cells than in mature cells mitocontrian are rod as parcel shaped granulosa to plasmic organelles with double membrane which surrounded fluid fell space or mitocontria matrix the auto membrane allows low molecular rate molecules to diffuse freely from one side of the membrane to the other the inner membrane of mitocontria is highly convoluted forming series of in folding cold crest mitocontria matrix is tens chelate proteinaceous material mitocontria are concerned with the oxidation of food materials by irobic respiration thes to energy in the form of edinoceln triphosphate or type matocontria are thus called par house of the cell glucose and oxygen reacts to give carbon dioxide water and release energy in the form of eight be ribosomes ribosomes are small tens rounded and granular particles in places they ago either freely in the cytoplasm are remain attached to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane ribosomes are the site of frotinesente cells endoplasmic reticulum endoplasmic reticulum is an extensive and complex network of inter connecting membrane system which joins the nuclear membrane at one end and the cell membrane of the other functionally and structurally two types of endoplasmic reticulum have been retina they are granular or rag endoplasmic reticulum at granular or smooth endoplasmic reticulum endoplasmic reticulum is composed of three different types of structures cisternae reticuls and tubules the endoplasmic reticulum acts as secretory storage and circulatory system for the cell golgi complex in the hyaplancells golgi complex are about one to three micro in length and are found scatter throughout the cytoplasm golgi complex made endoplasmic reticulum consists of three main parts cisternae dipoles and vesicers in plants golgi complex is mainly involved in the packaging of materials that has to be delivered either to the intercellular targets or securated outside the cell next organelle that we encounter in the cell is the largest structure recol recur is very important part of the cell as it serves as storage place and ar place for the plastic the cellular wastes records also perform osmoregulatry function in mature plantae cytoplasm across near the periphery of the cell and mate portion of the cell is occupide by large vacuole the vacuole of plants is enclosed by single membrane called tonoplast the vacuoles filled with regular call the regular apes compost of water final sols pigments etcetera of all the organelles present in the cell the most prominent organelle in the cell is nucleus nucleus is as spherical born like structure which controls the activity of organelles and place of major role in heredity nucleus is composed of nuclear membrane nucleoplasm nucleo lac and chromatin network nuclear membrane separates nucleus from the cytoplasm nucleoplasm nucleus has homogeneous matrix in which nucleolas and chromatin material remain suspended in every nucleus perical bodies called nucleolas are found which are chemically composed of or and at proteins and little amount of di and at new mis network of fine thread like chromatin fibre is also found in nucleoplasm new ring cell division chromatin gets coil and transforms into thick rod shaped structures caled chromosomes nutcromozon consists of two symmetrical strands called chromatids the two chromatids remain attached with each other and centromere this is the region of chromosome damages attached to the mitotic spindle during cell division however during the process of transtruction and replication the highly compact it chromosomes an cos certain specific protis which also compact the diene also gets displays the by exposing the underlying dine microbodies apart from these mention cell organelles small microbodies are also present in place microbodies are

Pisum Sativum, the fabusy is the third largest family of flowering plants it has more than eighteen thousand species another name for this family is papilionace al the family was called leguminouse the most scientifically study plant species that belongs to the fabaseefamily is paisimsetaivu it is he garden pea plant it is he fast growing plant with the tap root system and numerous lateral plant roots it is he weak stem flame as well the leaves of paise sation are alternate and pinnate having one to four pairs of leaflets with the few modify tendrils at the apex of each leaf its leaflets are shortly stack and ovechep at the bees of the petiole of each leaf and all the shape leafy stipe is locate which is much larger than the liflets isomsetivun is an annual growing plant that grows are to two meters it flowers from the month of may to the month ef setae the seeds ripened between guly and october the flowers of pisinsetaivum are born at the end of the auxiliary pedental with resim in florisans these flowers are arranged in ar row on the pedencal are means of apedisem and are associated with the brac thus flowers are penicillaand bracteate the structure and sheep of this flower is very peculiar and hence it is called papilionaceous this name has been derived from the name of the plant family papilionace this flower is bilaterally symmetrical hence it is zygomorphic it is complete flower with all the four worlds calyx corolla and drocium which is the male reproductive organ and gainocium which is the female reproductive organ all these four worlds are arranged successively on the palamus or receptacle which is the swollen end of the perice each floer is both and rotium and gainocium and since it exhibits self polynation therefore it is called bisectol and cleistogamous calyx is the outermost whorl of ar flower it consists of five sepals which are here and green in kale all the seples are fus together and are known as gamosepals they show valvate aestivation the next world is known as corolla it consists of five petals of different kales ranging from purple to what since all of them are free from each other they are called polypetles the petals are arranged in the form vexillary estivation the largest petal at the posteria is known as standard or vexilla alas are two lateral wing like petals which are shorter than the vexilla arena is the innermost to petals which are fuse to form of keel shaped structan the flower as tidal first androcium with ten times nine out of ten stamens unite into as trap and one stamen remains free each stamen as afilament which is attached to the base of the anther this type of anther is called pay fixed anther out of ten filaments nine are fuse to form of tube around the gainociun the gainotion as the symbol cable with the superior ovary curve style and its capitates the stigma in this flower the carpal occupies the topmost position on the thalamus the other floral parts like the sepals the petals and the stamens are placed below the cable thus the flower is called hypogynous flower the ovary is oblong and hairy with the single loci and many ovules all the ovules are arranged in arrow with marginal placentation after fertilisation the ovules develop into seeds and the ovary man shows into a fruit commonly the fruits of pisymsetivo marecalled pads apart is he dry days and fruit that

Dual nature of electron, we are well aware of the fat that electrons are tiny bits of matter but are we also aware that they show a unique dual behaviour that is they behave both as are particle and as of wave before learning it through an experiment let us first understand how particle behave they do this let take some macro sizes particles for examples of marbles on randomly shouting and allowing them to pass through asingle slit we observe ar patan of single band on the screen now what will happen if we replace the single slit with atouble slit we observe an identical secinband to the right the result ace as expected the marble at ar time either passes through one slit or through the other are falls down after striking the metal sheet this can happen only in the case of particles let us now see how waves behave the waves hit the slit and radiate out striking the screen with the maximum intensity directly in line with the save this line is exactly similar what we have seen in case of marbles but when we add the second slit something different happens an interference pattern is observed high intensity bright lines are formed where crests of waves overlap dark bands are observed where the crest of one wave is cancelled out by the trough of the other wave so we can conclude that when we allow particles to pass through double slits two bands are observed and when we allow waves to pass through double slits and interference patan of many bands is observe now that we have understood the behaviour of both waves and particles let see how an electron shows the nature of word they as single slit and allow the stream of electron to pass through have it behaves just like the marble that is it forms a single band we place the single slit with double slits and allow the electrons to pass through them if electrons were to behave like particles then we should now gate bands as in the case of marbles however something completely an expected happens we get an interference pattern like waves they thought may be the patent form is due to the interaction of these tiny bits of matter they next decided to shoot one electron at time so that there is no way they can interfere with each other however the same wave like interference pattern was observed after an over since this astounded the physicists they the sided to research further they thought of seeing which slit it ac to ly goes through so they put in a detecture upon observation the electrons started behaving like marbles they produced ar pattern of two bands instead of an interference pattern this proves that electron can behave both like are particle and ar wave and hence shows dual nature,"['single slit', 'ar wave', 'intensity bright', 'macro sizes particles', 'ar pattern', 'slit', 'dark bands', 'patent form', 'double slits', 'metal sheet', 'identical secinband', 'tiny bits', 'dual', 'intensity', 'wave', 'ar', 'bands', 'single', 'pattern', 'particles']"
Applications of Electrolysis, electrolysis is the decomposition of electrolyte in actors of few state into ions through passage of electricity electrolysis has he white application and varies industrial processes the three broad applications of electrolysis are electro refining electroplating and extraction of metals that is electrometallurgy electro refining is the process of obtaining pure metals through electrolysis in this process impurity scar extracted from crude metals ar value salt of the metal to be purified is taken as electrolyte the impure metal is taken as anode while pure metal is used as cathode at thelent of the electrolysis metal ions move from anode through electrolyte and lecteposited at cathode or metal is of plane at cathode while impurity is elected or and as anode mud various metals like copper metal sin thin gold silver etcetera are refined through electrolysis commercially electroplating is the process by wide akin and compact for of an nondryactive also perialmetal is deposited on an article made of ar more reactive or inferior metal in theory electroplating is somewhat similar to electro refining only difference between the two processes is that eelectoplating the electrodes the object on which the electroplating has to be carried out electroplating is widely used in everyday light et is us to prevent corrosion of metals for example gromiumplating is done on car parts sometimes it is us or dlectorative purposes like gold is lated over brass items electrolysis is used to the manefacture of various metals like aluminium potassium magnesium calcium and sodium through electrolysis of fus electrolytes electrometallurgy is an electrolytic process used for extraction of metals from its bold verious other compounds like sodium carbonate white led and potassium hydroxide are also obtained through electrolysis elindastrial setup,"['electrolysis metal', 'mud various metals', 'metals ar value', 'electro refining electroplating', 'electrometallurgy electro refining', 'electrolysis elindastrial', 'items electrolysis', 'various metals', 'metal', 'carbonate white', 'verious other', 'potassium magnesium', 'gold silver', 'process impurity', 'electrolytes electrometallurgy', 'electro refining', 'few state', 'electrolysis', 'metals', 'potassium', 'gold', 'impurity', 'process', 'white', 'electroplating', 'ar', 'industrial']"

Friction: Its Cause and Factor, do early humans discovered fire by rubbing two stones against each other you must have also felt that your hands feel on when you rub them together for a few seconds do you know the reason behind this phenomena when two stones or palms are rubbed against each other the motion of the stones or palms is resisted by some invisible factor that is responsible for producing heat in both cases each is produced due to the force of friction that acts between the two surfaces in contact whenever two objects strike to move or actually move over each other ar force of friction comes in to contact that tends to oppose the relative motion of an object over the other is friction the same for all the surfaces no it is not whether the friction between two surfaces will be small or large depends on the rouness of the two surfaces in contact as mol surface offers less friction whereas an irregular surfacs office more friction to understand this better let us perform as simple activitate the materials required for this activity are as spring balance ar brick ar metallic string ar piece of polythene tie the metallic spring around the brick and connect the hoop of the spring balance to it now hold the other end of spring balance and put it towards the of cell as soon as the brick starts to move check the reading in the spring balance and noted down it gives you are measure of the force of friction between the surface of the brick and the floor now rape the polythene around the brick and again tie astring around et connect the spring balance to the spring and pull the brick again no down the reading on the spring balance as soon as the brick starts to move what do you observe you will observe that the force of friction is less this time this is because the surface of the polythene is very smooth as compared to the irregulae surface of the brect let us perform another activity to have more clarity about the variation of friction based on the nature of the surface the materials required for this activity ar ar wooden wedge atoicar at table sand pleas the wooden wedge on as smooth floor from the top of the wooden wedge allow the toy car to slight down you will observe that after or rings on distance on the floor the toy car stops no down the distance covered by the toy car on the floor now spread the table uniformly over the floor insuring that there are no rings again from the top of the wooden ridge allow the toy to slight down and as it stops no down the distance covered by it over the table now remove the table from the floor and spread at then lear of sand uniformly over the floor again allow the toy car to slide down from the top of the wooden bridge as it stops no down the distance covered by it on the sandy floor compare all the three distances covered by the toy car before coming to rest you will observe that the toy car has covered maximum distance on the smooth floor and minimum distance on the sandy floor do you know why this is because the irregularities are minimum on the surface of the smooth floor and maximum on the surface of the sandy floor these irregularities are responsible for the increase in frictional floors even to surfaces which appear very smooth have al large number of minute irregularities on them that up struck the motion of an object the friction acting on an object also the pens on the rate of the object it is difficult to move are heavier object on a floor as compared to ar lighter object as the heavier object experiences more friction as compared to the lighter object do you know why this is because inter lacking between the irregularities of the two surfaces in contact is more in the case of the heavier object as compared to te lighter object thus heavier objects of or more friction as compared to lighter object so in this animation we have learned that the for of friction produces heat friction is the force that opposes the relative motion between two objects the false of friction increases with the roughness of the surface the force of friction on an object increases with its fat,"['ar ar wooden wedge', 'surfacs office more friction', 'more friction', 'ar metallic', 'other ar', 'wooden wedge', 'friction increases', 'heavier object', 'object increases', 'ar', 'toy car', 'table sand', 'other end', 'polythene tie', 'relative motion', 'invisible factor', 'few seconds', 'early humans', 'friction', 'wooden', 'object', 'more', 'distance', 'floor', 'surface', 'large', 'metallic', 'heavier', 'frictional', 'irregularities', 'sand', 'toy', 'table', 'tie', 'polythene', 'motion', 'other']"

Locomotion in Frog, frogs and toads are amphibians thus they are well adapted to live in water and on land they can move from one place to another by leaping swimming or crawling frogs leap when they are on a solid surface the hind limbs and the four limbs play important rods in leaping they are muscular and much longer than the fore limbs at the beginning of leaping the hind limbs give up push to the body to move forward after a strong and forward push these limbs becomes tray during this movement the body remaimbs trait upwards and the four limbs take close to the body while landing the four limbs move forward to support the body and the hind limbs bend to take back the set shape position at the end of the leap the frog comes to the resting position and regains energy to take the next leap continuous leaping helps the frog to cover long distans and short time ten frogs being in pebiumbs tend the significant part of their life and water hence they are well adapted to the aquatic life some of the major adapted features are positions of nostril strong hind limb webbed feet tree line body and tail limbs in case of tadpole during swimming frogs keep their nostrils outside water in order to respire the completely filled lungs and the stretched limbs tgiven upward thrust to the frog the strong muscles of the hind limbs help in powerful backward stroke hence the hind limb act like paddles that push the water backwards which in turn facilitate the forward motion of the body the wet feet of the hind limbs help to increase the surface area of the food which in turn facilitates effective fro portion through water the hind limbs help in swimming and the four limbs help in giving directions to the body the body of the frog is streamlined as it has pointed ends and broad centre this physical feature helps to many might the resistance posed by the aquatic medium thereby decreasing the effort required for forward motion that poles of the frogs mostly have large tail limbs which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side frogs also show crawling motion this motion is mainly observed when the frogs are on the ground or climbing or vertical surface like a tree trunk or a rock leaping swimming and craling are the three types of locomotion which are common in all the different species of frogs and toads,"['feet tree line', 'hind limbs', 'frogs leap', 'tail limbs', 'strong hind', 'leap continuous', 'shape position', 'limbs', 'physical feature', 'broad centre', 'forward motion', 'significant part', 'short time', 'long distans', 'important rods', 'surface', 'tree', 'frogs', 'leap', 'strong', 'hind', 'fro', 'backward', 'aquatic', 'position', 'feet', 'tail', 'different', 'motion', 'forward']"

Colloids_CBSE, we all consume mi in different forms we drink milk in the form of chocolat milk or in breakfast with ar bull of conflict or gelia and on festivals we love having keel made from milk milk appears as ar white liquid with us move texture but did you know that milk is mostly water with he lot of tiny fat and rooting globules floating around in it milk is are co lot or ar colloidal solution so what are co lots that us no more about then acoloid is at type of mixture made up of particles that are uniformly distributed in as solution the particles are small ranging in sites from one to on those nanometas the different components cannot be seen with the naked eye just as in male you are probably wondering if or co lot is ar homogeneous mixture let take ea look at the properties of ar colloidal solution acoloid appears to be homogeneous because of its small sides but it is actually are heterogeneous mixture let us understand how coloits differ from homogeneous mixtures tictwobeakers of watr this all some sugar in one beaker to form are sugar solution in the second beaker dissolve some mill now china part beam on the two solutions what do you observe light is scattered by colloidal particles in mi and the path of the light beam is visible when viewed from the side however the sugar solution is are homogeneous mixture that does not scatter light as he result the path of light is not visible through at the scattering of light by colloidal particles is non as tin the effect if few ever had the opportunity to of through at dense forest you would observe this effect mist is made up of tiny drop the of water that scatter sunlight as it passes through the canopy of the fore the tender effect can alsolescene when abemof light and thes are dark room through are smaller hole or window the path of light becomes visible due to the light scattered by dust particles in the room the tender effect is shown by particles that are large of to scattered the lid colloidal particles are larger in sites than particles of ar true solution such as sugar in water and thus show this effect you are probably wondering if co lots are similar to suspensions let look at the deferens between colloids and suspensions when we make at of suspension in water and leave it for or wild the large particles settle to the ate however when ar colloidal solution that as milk is kept for avile the flat globules do not settle to the bottom this happens because the colloidal solution contains smaller particles than suspensions these particles do not settle and remain suspended in helical we now know that the sides of acolodal particle is between that of ar true solution and ar suspension can filtration be used to separate colloidal particles no the cascoloids are so small that the pass through of filter paper so filtration cannot be used to separate them from ar mixture then how do they get separated to separate the colloidal particles special separation ticni no nascentyfugation is use the is now look at the components of ar colloidal solution ea colloidal solution has two componen similar to as solution which are the dispersed phase and the dispersing medium the disposed face is the solute like component of the colloidal solution the disposing medium is the solvent like component in which the dispersed phase is suspended the dispersed phase and disposing medium can be solid liquid or gas these on the physical state of the two faces coloits are classified into salt emulsion form gal an arosol the dispersed phase and disposing medium can be solid liquid or gas these on the physical state of the two faces coloits are classified into salt emulsion form gal an arosol lets take an look at some of these coloides sol is the colloidal solution of disposed solid particles in liquid as an example consider made wt solid so is formed by mixing solids in asolid faces for example are coloured gemstone emulsion is the combination of two liquids for instance oil in water or milk when gas is dispersed in liquid form forms for example so bubbles and shaving cream when gas is dispersed in asolid for example formic stone solid form is formed jealous formed by combining ar solid as are disposing medium and are liquid as are dispersed phase good cheese and jelly are just a few examples aerosol is made up of small

Increasing and Reducing Friction_CBSE, in he game of football you might have seen spite or starts beneath the shoes of afootballer these pits prevent the player from slipping on grass and help to run faster or changes direction quickly without slipping do you know what will happen it football is placed on icy ground wearing shoes without spikes yes the footballers will not be able to run at all rather each time they tried to tick the ball they will slip the spite in thecthoes provide africtional force by criping the grass ground and thus provide the players are better control of their body however when clears strike to run on icy ground by wearing shoes without spikes then the frictional force almost vanishes so the pleas easily lose the can rod over their movement and they slab the force of friction place are very vital role while we are performing are day to the activities like writing holding objects waking applying breaks in bicycles although friction seems to be necessary for performing almost all day to the activities it has its cos as well it is the frictional force that causes the injury when you accidentally fall round without friction it would be like slipping on is you might also have observed that your shoes get where and their after prolonged is this is due to friction in the absence of friction you would not frequired new shoes as long as the exist in shoe fic you fed in the absence of frictional force if you readily of cycle von or twice you would keep going on and on thus we waste are lot of energy overcoming the frictional force which opposes are motion as friction has both its trees and cones so it is called are necessary evils based on the need sometimes we need to increase friction and sometimes we need to reduce it tiles of wecles are tread it to provide better grip as it increases the friction and holds the ground firmly we deliberately increase friction by us in great parts in the brakes ten of bicycles and automobiles when you are riding he bicycle the break parts do not touch the vels but when you press the break lever these part sees the motion of the rim due to friction and the wheel stops moving in some situations however friction is undesirable and we would want to minimise it you must have played the game of carom why do you sprinkle fine powder on the carumbod this is because the fine powder reduces the friction between the boat and the caramcoins due to which garamcoins move smoothly over the boat most machines require repair and maintenance because of frictional force the friction between parts over time is responsible for a majority of the variant their in a machine when oil trees and grafite is applied between the moving parts of or machine are thin layer is formed there and the moving surfaces do not directly rub against each other inter aging of irregularities is avoided to a great extent due to which movement becomes more the substances which reduce friction are called lubrican so are learning in this animation can be summarised as follows frictional force increases with the increase in the roness of the surface in contact frictional force decreases with the increase in the move ness of the surface in contact force of friction is necessary for performing day to the activities like writing holding objects walking applying brakes frictional force is responsible for injury upon following accident lay the effort to do work increases with the increase in force of friction lubricants and powder decrease the friction between surfaces in contact,"['frictional force increases', 'contact frictional force', 'frictional force', 'contact force', 'break parts', 'great parts', 'better control', 'grass ground', 'icy ground', 'work increases', 'thin layer', 'oil trees', 'caramcoins due', 'fine powder', 'necessary evils', 'cycle von', 'shoe fic', 'new shoes', 'holding objects', 'vital role', 'force', 'inter', 'most', 'ground', 'better', 'friction', 'great', 'break', 'parts', 'powder', 'increases', 'trees', 'due', 'necessary', 'shoes', 'contact', 'grass']"
The Solenoid, yes this is one of the metal to start old generation cars but now days we can start or car by simply is on the have you ever wondered what makes are car starts so easily now it is ar solenoid assembled with the car state motor when the car fi is turned on ar small current from the battery flows through the solenoid assemble with the cards state motor on passing the electric current through the solenoid it gets magnetite and thus causes aflunger to come out which completes the electric cerci turning on the state motor which in turn starts the cars engine but what exactly is to solenoid ar solenoid is along tag wound helical coil of conducting wire as the turns are closely spaced thus each turn can be considered as ar sulcular loop along solenoig means the length of the solenoid is much greater than its diameter when an electric current is passed through the solenoid ar magnetic field is produced around it remember the wire is used for making the solenoid at enamel that is these are insulated wires so that each turn remains in solated from the other turn but why insulation is so important it is because for the coil to behave as or solenoid the electric current should pass through each turn but if we use ar wire without insulation then the electric current will flow through the shortest path getting short circuit it and ultimately the wire will not behave as the solenoid we just stated that the solenoid produces are magnetic field can you think what is the net magnetic field produced by ar current carrying solenoid as each turn behaves as ar sulcular loop thus the net magnetic field is the water sum of the fields due to all the turns but if we close lie observe the pattern of magnetic field lines of a solenoid then it is found that inside and ideal solenoid magnetic field ones are uniform and parallel to the solenoid excess on the other hand the magnetic field lines out sad the solenoid are far apart and hence field strength is wide we can you think of the reason behind it when the solenoid is closely observed it is found that the points near the turns behave almost as straight conductor and hence the magnetic field lines reduced around them are concentric circus thus the fields which we the two edges and turns can sol out each other and the net magnetic field is produced in the shown pattern but how do you calculate the net magnecfued of the magnetic field produced by as solenoid to find the net magnetic field lets derive or formula using amperes low consider are rectangular ampere an loop abcd cd is outside the solenoid and for an ideal solenoid magnetic field outside it is zero along transfor sections by and base the field component the zero since be is inside the solenoid and parallel to the solenoid axes cens or be is the only arm having magnetic field along at thus the relevant length of the emperian loop is ll if be the number of turns for unit length then the total number of turns is an ll the current enclosed in the loop i enclosed is equal to aid into in into ll where eye is the current flowing through the solenoid on applying amperes law to the loop ab the integral of vector be the ll equals to me not eye in closed comes out to be bel is equal to be not in closed since i enclosed is equal to the product of total current in the loop ea and the total number of tones in the solenoid and thus the magnetic field be is equal to me not in aid so with the help of of field formula we can now calculate the numerical value of the produced magnetic field but can we predict the direction of this produced magnetic field no then how can we do it the direction of the magnetic field produced by solenoid is given by the right hand rule according to right hand rule when we rappour right hand around the solenoid with the fingers in the direction of the conventional current then the thumb points in the direction of the magnetic north pole let us now verify the right hand rule with the help of an interesting activity to perform this activity we need the solenoid ar cylendrical magnet ar battery and are one way key connect the solenoid with the battery by ar one way key place the cylendrical magnet with its north pole inside the solenoid now in site plaque what do we observe yes the magnet gets repelled but why the repulsion of magnet suggest that pole of the solenoid in directing with the magnet must be acting as north pole since like poles repel each other to check it let us now apply right hand rule on the solenoid grasped the solenoid with your right hand in such away that the fingers are curled anticlockwise which is the direction of electric current flowing through the solenoid the thumb points in the direction of north pole thus right hand rule is verified and now you must have also understood how the plunger inside the solenoid slide to complete the state motor circuit of canals,"['solenoid ar magnetic field', 'solenoid ar solenoid', 'solenoid magnetic field',

Introduction to Kinetic Energy, when we shoot an arrow from the bow we observe that it hits the target but if we throw the same arrow without using the bow then it does not pierce the same target do you know why the distance travelled by the arrow in the two cases is different it is because the energy possessed by the arrow in the two cases is different in the first case the arrow possessed most speed and thus more energy so it covered more distance and was able to pierce into the target while in the second case the speed of the arrow and thereby the energy of the arrow was less and so it could not travel sufficient distance to pierce the target the energy possessed by a body by virtue of its motion is known as the carnetic energy of the body the word carnetic is derived from greekword carniticouse which means to move idely stationary body possesses no canetic energy the essaunet of canetic energy is jewel,"['carnetic energy', 'more energy', 'more distance', 'most speed', 'energy', 'case', 'same', 'distance', 'carnetic', 'body', 'speed']"

Lightning, during the development of thunderstorm the re currants move upward while the water droplets move downward these vigorous movements cause separation of charges the positive charges collect near the upper edges of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate near the lower edges the magnitude of accumulated charges becomes so large that are cannot resist their flow and negative and positive charges meat producing treats of bright light and sound these these seats as lightning and the process is known as electric discharge lightning conductor is used to protect buildings from the effect of lightning it is installed in the walls of the building during its construction it provides an easy root for the transfer of electric charge to the ground,"['electric discharge lightning', 'vigorous movements', 'water droplets', 're currants', 'edges', 'charges', 'electric', 'lightning', 'bright']"
Heart external features, whenever we put our hands on the left side of our chest we feel that our heart is beating constantly hard beat can be felt at the left side as our heart is slightly tilted towards this side and located in the thoracic cavity between the lungs do you know the size of this white logan cling our fist and you will get to know it the size of our heart is similar to our clenched fist it is approximately twelve centimetres long nine centimetres wide at the base and six centimetres that it was around two hundred and fifty to three hundred and fifty grounds do you know how does our heart possess the amazing ability to beat continuously without fail the answer to this query lies in its strata our heart is made up of specialised muscles called cardiac muscles these muscles have special properties of excitability and conduction in addition to contractility these specialised muscles enable the heart to beat continuously in order to circulate the blood through blood vessels around the body the blood whistles which supply oxygenated blood to the heart are coronary arteries while those that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart are cardiac uains can you observe that the coronary arteries and cardiac veins are embedded in the yellow coloured tissue this is the epicardial fat the blood wristles and the epicardial fats are present in the grooves or salty sulky or visible externally as the divisions of internal chambers of the hear the groove which marks the division between the oricles and the ventricles is the coronary sulkas on the other hand the groove which separates both the ventricles is the into ventricular sales since the heart is or vitalogan it has to be very well protect for that it has at double membrane structure called pericardium around at between these two deers there is ar pericardial fluid which acts as are shock absorber and reduces the friction due to the hearts movement membrane as protection is not enough for this whitelogan so it is enclosed in or ribcain this way our body has been designed to provide extra protection to vitalogans like heart,"['movement membrane', 'cardiac muscles', 'ventricular sales', 'other hand', 'internal chambers', 'salty sulky', 'special properties', 'amazing ability', 'white logan', 'thoracic cavity', 'hard beat', 'left side', 'blood', 'membrane', 'cardiac', 'pericardial', 'epicardial', 'coronary', 'centimetres', 'muscles', 'beat', 'side']"
Comparison of Rational Numbers, altitudes of two man tons relative to sea level are shown here which mountain is higher to answer this question unique to now which of the two given rational numbers is greater we will learn two methods to compare rational numbers the first one is common denominator method step one find the else am of the denominators of the rational numbers here the else an of two an five is ten step to three equivalent rational numbers with denominator as the else am obtained in step one the equivalent rational number of sixty five upon two with denominator tan is three hundred twenty five upon ten and the equivalent trational number of one hundred six upon five with denominator is two hundred twelve upon ten step three compare the numerators of the rational numbers obtained the number having greater numerator is the greater rational number here three hundred twenty five is greater than two hundred twelve so three hundred twenty five upon then is greater than two hundred twelve upon ten hence sixty five upon two is greater than one hundred six upon five therefore the mountain with altitude sixty five upon two tilomiters is higher we have another quick an shorter method to find the same which is called cross multiplying method step one multiply the numerator of the first rational number with denominator of the second rational number sixty five multiplied by five is equal to three hundred twenty five step to multiplied the numerator of the second rational number with denominator of the first rational number one hundred six multiplied by two is equal to two hundred twelve step three compared the products obtained here three hundred twenty five is greater than two hundred twelve so sixty five upon two is greater than one hundred six upon five in general if upon be and se upon ni or rational numbers such that be and the are positive and if multiplied by the is greater than be multiplied by se then upon b is greater than se upon the if ga multiplied by the is equal to be multiplied by se then upon b is equal to se upon if ga multiplied by the is less than the multiplied by se then upon b is less than se upon what if you are given positive rational number and the negative rational number you might already known that he negative number is always less than positive number so negative nine upon at is less than seven upon eleven its time to compare two negative rational numbers which of the two rational numbers negative five upon three and negative twenty five upon for is greater we already know that the number on the left on number line is smaller than the number to its right from this we can in for that three is less than for because three is to the left if full but negative three is greater than negative for because negative three is to the right of negative for seem can be seen for rational numbers on the number line three upon at is less than for upon eight but negative three upon at is greater than negative for upon eight so to compare two negative rational numbers let us first compare them with out their signs as learned previously else am of three an for is twelve equivalent rational numbers of five upon three an twenty five upon for or twenty upon twelve and seventy five upon twelve respectively here twenty is less than seventy five so twenty upon twelve is less than seventy five upon twelve hence five upon three is less than twenty five upon for therefore negative five upon three is greater than negative twenty five upon for its time to take a quick re cap you have learnt two methods to compare two rational numbers first is the common denominator method second is the cross multiplying method,"['negative rational number', 'greater rational number', 'equivalent rational number', 'positive rational number', 'rational numbers negative', 'negative rational numbers', 'equivalent rational numbers', 'rational number', 'rational numbers', 'denominator method', 'equivalent trational number', 'multiplying method', 'negative number', 'positive number', 'method', 'else am', 'question unique', 'sea level', 'number', 'denominator', 're', 'tons', 'negative', 'else', 'greater', 'positive']"
